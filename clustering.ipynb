    "# Final project guidelines\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Use these guidelines if and only if you are pursuing a **final project of your own design**. For those taking the final exam instead of the project, see the (separate) final exam notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Guidelines\n",
    "\n",
    "These guidelines are intended for **undergraduates enrolled in INFO 3350**. If you are a graduate student enrolled in INFO 6350, you're welcome to consult the information below, but you have wider latitude to design and develop your project in line with your research goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The task\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to: identify an interesting problem connected to the humanities or humanistic social sciences that's addressable with the help of computational methods, formulate a hypothesis about it, devise an experiment or experiments to test your hypothesis, present the results of your investigations, and discuss your findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "These tasks essentially replicate the process of writing an academic paper. You can think of your project as a paper in miniature.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are free to present each of these tasks as you see fit. You should use narrative text (that is, your own writing in a markdown cell), citations of others' work, numerical results, tables of data, and static and/or interactive visualizations as appropriate. Total length is flexible and depends on the number of people involved in the work, as well as the specific balance you strike between the ambition of your question and the sophistication of your methods. But be aware that numbers never, ever speak for themselves. Quantitative results presented without substantial discussion will not earn high marks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your project should reflect, at minimum, ten **or more** hours of work by each participant, though you will be graded on the quality of your work, not the amount of time it took you to produce it. Most high-quality projects represent twenty or more hours of work by each member.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pick an important and interesting problem!\n",
    "\n",
    "No amount of technical sophistication will overcome a fundamentally uninteresting problem at the core of your work. You have seen many pieces of successful computational humanities research over the course of the semester. You might use these as a guide to the kinds of problems that interest scholars in a range of humanities disciplines. You may also want to spend some time in the library, reading recent books and articles in the professional literature. **Problem selection and motivation are integral parts of the project.** Do not neglect them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Format\n",
    "\n",
    "You should submit your project as a Jupyter notebook, along with all data necessary to reproduce your analysis. If your dataset is too large to share easily, let us know in advance so that we can find a workaround. If you have a reason to prefer a presentation format other than a notebook, likewise let us know so that we can discuss the options.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your report should have four basic sections (provided in cells below for ease of reference):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Introduction and hypothesis.** What problem are you working on? Why is it interesting and important? What have other people said about it? What do you expect to find?\n",
    "2. **Corpus, data, and methods.** What data have you used? Where did it come from? How did you collect it? What are its limitations or omissions? What major methods will you use to analyze it? Why are those methods the appropriate ones?\n",
    "3. **Results.** What did you find? How did you find it? How should we read your figures? Be sure to include confidence intervals or other measures of statistical significance or uncetainty where appropriate.\n",
    "4. **Discussion and conclusions.** What does it all mean? Do your results support your hypothesis? Why or why not? What are the limitations of your study and how might those limitations be addressed in future work?\n",
    "\n",
    "Within each of those sections, you may use as many code and markdown cells as you like. You may, of course, address additional questions or issues not listed above.\n",
    "\n",
    "All code used in the project should be present in the notebook (except for widely-available libraries that you import), but **be sure that we can read and understand your report in full without rerunning the code**. Be sure, too, to explain what you're doing along the way, both by describing your data and methods and by writing clean, well commented code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Grading\n",
    "\n",
    "This project takes the place of the take-home final exam for the course. It is worth 35% of your overall grade. You will be graded on the quality and ambition of each aspect of the project. No single component is more important than the others.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical details\n",
    "\n",
    "* The project is due at **noon on Saturday, December 9** via upload to CMS of a single zip file containing your fully executed Jupyter notebook and all associated data.\n",
    "* You may work alone or in a group of up to three total members.\n",
    "    * If you work in a group, be sure to list the names of the group members.\n",
    "    * For groups, create your group on CMS and submit one notebook for the entire group. **Each group should also submit a statement of responsibility** that describes in general terms who performed which parts of the project.\n",
    "* You may post questions on Ed, but should do so privately (visible to course staff only).\n",
    "* Interactive visualizations do not always work when embedded in shared notebooks. If you plan to use interactives, you may need to host them elsewhere and link to them.\n",

    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In an era marked by unprecedented political polarization, the focus on media and its role in shaping public perception has never been more critical. This data project delves into the intricate web of language, word choice, and stylistic choices employed by various news outlets when reporting on current events, with a keen emphasis on political partisanship.\n",
    "\n",
    "The importance of this investigation lies in its potential to uncover implicit biases within media narratives and disseminated information. Firstly, we scrutinize the diction and connotations used to describe events among news outlets, seeking to discern patterns that determine whether their choice of words or coverage of events indicates a leaning towards a particular political party. Simultaneously, we conduct a comparative analysis of language used by different media outlets (across the political spectrum) when covering the same events, unraveling distinct narratives crafted by left-wing and right-wing sources to evaluate the implications of these differing perspectives. Secondly, the exploration extends beyond mere observation, delving into whether certain events are portrayed with a comparably positive or negative bias, contributing to the broader discourse on media objectivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The significance of this research is far-reaching and transcends academic curiosity. It holds profound implications for societal awareness and media literacy. By making citizens aware of potential echo chambers in media consumption, the project aims to empower individuals to critically evaluate the information they receive. Beyond mere awareness, our project aspires to offer recommendations for news outlets and media that demonstrate a more neutral stance, allowing consumers to make informed choices about their news sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Existing literature reviews have already shed light on the political slant present in many media sources (the picture below from AllSides is widely used when looking at the media outlets). This project builds upon this foundation, seeking not only to confirm these biases but also to provide a nuanced understanding of the language that perpetuates them. As political polarization continues to shape the socio-political landscape, this research contributes to the ongoing dialogue by exploring the correlation between media language and the evolving dynamics of political partisanship.\n",

I 118th CONGRESS 1st Session H. R. 632 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES January 30, 2023 Mr. Norman (for himself, Mr. Duncan , Mr. Gaetz , Mrs. Miller of Illinois , Mr. Allen , Mr. Sessions , Mr. Carl , Mr. Cloud , Mr. Waltz , Mr. Lamborn , Mr. Luetkemeyer , Mr. Banks , Mr. Aderholt , Mr. Palmer , Mrs. Harshbarger , Mr. Johnson of Louisiana , Mr. Gosar , Mr. Biggs , Mr. Bishop of North Carolina , Mr. Wenstrup , Mr. Rosendale , Mr. Westerman , Mr. Moolenaar , Mr. Santos , Mr. Weber of Texas , Mr. Kelly of Mississippi , Mr. Moylan , Mr. Good of Virginia , Mr. Webster of Florida , and Mr. Mooney ) introduced the following bill; which was referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce A BILL To amend title XIX of the Social Security Act and Public Health Service Act to improve the reporting of abortion data to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and for other purposes. 1. Short title This Act may be cited as the Ensuring Accurate and Complete Abortion Data Reporting Act of 2023 . 2. Findings Congress finds the following: (1) Reporting abortion data has been voluntary in the past, which has not resulted in complete data being submitted to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. (2) While the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention requests specific data points from each State and the District of Columbia, there is a great variety in the information collected and published by the States. (3) In fact, there is not a single abortion data point publicly reported for all fifty States and the District of Columbia. (4) Even more alarming, three States that together account for 15 percent of the United States population of women of childbearing age do not report any abortion data to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. (5) Accurate statistical data regarding abortion and those who survive abortion attempts is critical to public health and policy analysis. 3. Medicaid payments for certain family planning services and supplies contingent on submission of abortion data to CDC Section 1903 of the Social Security Act ( 42 U.S.C. 1396b ) is amended— (1) in subsection (a)(5), by inserting before an amount equal to the following: subject to subsection (cc), ; and (2) by adding at the end the following new subsection: (cc) Annual reports on abortion data (1) In general Subject to paragraph (2), as a condition of receiving payment under subsection (a)(5) with respect to any amount expended during a year (beginning with the year following two years after the date of the enactment of this subsection) for family planning services and supplies described in section 1905(a)(4)(C) furnished to an individual described in section 1902(ii) or an individual whose medical assistance under this title is limited to such services and supplies furnished pursuant to a waiver granted under section 1115, each State shall, by not later than December 31 of the previous year, submit to the abortion surveillance system of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, with respect to the year before the previous year, at least abortion data regarding the mandatory questions described in section 317W(a)(3)(A) of the Public Health Service Act. (2) Late submission of reports With respect to a year, in the case of a State that does not submit by December 31 of the previous year the abortion data required under paragraph (1) with respect to the year before the previous year but submits such data by December 31 of the year, such State shall continue to receive payment, including retroactive payment, under subsection (a)(5) with respect to any amount expended during the year for family planning services and supplies described in section 1905(a)(4)(C) furnished to an individual described in such paragraph. (3) Certification of abortion data (A) In general With respect to each submission of abortion data under this subsection, a State shall certify to the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that such data is accurate. (B) False information In the case that the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention determines that a State has knowingly provided false information with respect to a submission of abortion data under this subsection, such State may not receive payment under subsection (a)(5) with respect to any amount expended during the first full fiscal year following such determination for family planning services and supplies described in section 1905(a)(4)(C) furnished to an individual described in paragraph (1). . 4.

(2) Prohibition on availability of funds to carry out memorandum No funds may be obligated or expended to carry out the memorandum specified in paragraph (1) or any successor to such memorandum.

Short title This Act may be cited as the Ending Chemical Abortions Act of 2023 . 2. Findings Congress finds the following: (1) In 2000, the Food and Drug Administration approved chemical abortion drugs for use in the United States. The agency illegally categorized pregnancy as an illness and asserted chemical abortion drugs provide a meaningful therapeutic benefit. (2) In 2016, the Food and Drug Administration reduced the number of doctor visits required for administration of chemical abortion drugs from 3 visits to 1 visit. The agency also removed the requirement for both the in-person administration of misoprostol and a subsequent follow-up appointment. At this time, the agency also expanded the availability of inducing a chemical abortion from 7 to 10 weeks. (3) In 2021, the Food and Drug Administration eliminated the in-person dispensing requirement for chemical abortion drugs, purporting to allow these drugs to be dispensed by mail in violation of longstanding Federal law. (4) When compared to surgical abortions, chemical abortions are consistently more likely to result in complications that are miscoded as a spontaneous abortion or miscarriage . (5) According to the Guttmacher Institute, the Abortion Industry’s think tank, since 2000, the administration of mifepristone and misoprostol has grown to comprise over 50 percent of all induced abortions in the United States. (6) There is a four times higher risk of experiencing complications due to a chemical abortion than a surgical abortion. 3.

I 118th CONGRESS 1st Session H. R. 4303 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES June 22, 2023 Ms. Pressley (for herself, Ms. Williams of Georgia , Ms. Escobar , Ms. Bush , and Mr. Frost ) introduced the following bill; which was referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce , and in addition to the Committees on Ways and Means , the Judiciary , Natural Resources , Armed Services , Veterans' Affairs , Oversight and Accountability , and Foreign Affairs , for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned A BILL To expand access to abortion care. 1. Short title This Act may be cited as the Abortion Justice Act of 2023 . 2. Findings Congress finds the following: (1) Abortion care is essential health care that should be affordable, available, and supported for everyone who needs it. (2) On June 24, 2022, the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and 50 years of legal precedent, and Roe v. Wade was never enough. Without the ability to access abortion, the legal right did not help many people working to make ends meet, who are Black, Indigenous, Asian, Pacific Islander, Latinx, young people, LGBTQ+ people, immigrants, disabled people and gender nonconforming people. (3) Almost one-third (29 percent) of the total United States population of women of reproductive age are currently living in States where abortion is either unavailable or severely restricted and a dozen other States are certain or likely to ban abortion in the future. (4) Systemic racism, economic insecurity, abelism, and a dehumanizing immigration system exacerbate the already-massive barriers to abortion care. (5) While abortion bans and other legal restrictions harm all people who are or may become pregnant, they cause even greater harm to those already subject to systemic racism and economic injustice. (6) Pregnancy is less safe for some than others because of historic and ongoing racism and discrimination in health care settings, and Black and Indigenous individuals face two to three times the risk of dying from pregnancy-related causes. Individuals in States banning or severely restricting access to abortion care also have worse maternal health outcomes. (7) Forced pregnancy is always unconscionable, and particularly so for individuals facing heightened risk of maternal mortality and morbidity, where pregnancy is less safe for some than others because of historic and ongoing racism and discrimination in health care settings. (8) Maternal deaths in 2020 were 62 percent higher in States where abortion is heavily restricted than in States where abortion was available, and a Federal ban on abortion would increase maternal mortality by an estimated 24 percent. (9) Congress has the authority to act pursuant to the commerce clause, the necessary and proper clause, and section 5 of the 14th Amendment. (10) Attacks on bodily autonomy are not limited to threats on abortion care. This year alone, more than 120 bills have been introduced attacking gender-affirming care. States have attempted to outlaw many forms of birth control, and 15 States have near total abortion bans. (11) Several State courts have found that abortion restrictions violate the right to bodily autonomy. (12) The criminalization of abortion care forces people to travel hundreds of miles out of their community to try to get care. (13) As in other forms of criminalization, the people targeted for pregnancy loss and self-managed abortion prosecution are disproportionately people of color, immigrants, and people experiencing economic insecurity. (14) Throughout the more than 20 years that it has been used in the United States, medication abortion has been proven to be overwhelmingly safe and effective, and has expanded the way people choose to self manage their abortion. (15) All Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs must be available in all States and territories. (16) Research shows that with access to safe, effective methods and accurate information, people may safely self-manage an abortion on their own. Anyone who decides to end a pregnancy should be able to choose to self-manage an abortion at home with medical guidance and the support they want. (17) Abortion needs to be accessible where people live and where they access health care. For young adults on college campuses, student health centers are often where they access the full range of care they need, and medication abortion must be accessible and available to young adults who get their health insurance through their State colleges and universities, and three States (Massachusetts, New York, and California) have passed laws ensuring access to medication abortion on college campuses. (18) States have continually crafted legal restrictions to ensure that abortion care is burdensome or impossible to obtain. This strategy has led to more than 1,300 abortion restrictions enacted since Roe v. Wade was originally decided in 1973. These attacks are rooted in racism and compound the failures of the health care and economic systems to provide communities living with low incomes access to high-quality, affordable health care, and safe and sustainable communities. (19) A lack of investment in both telehealth and reproductive health care is a significant barrier to an equitable experience of telehealth for medication abortion care. Actualizing the promise of telehealth and technology requires centering equity by investing in broadband, cultural competency, health literacy, and digital and physical infrastructure development. (20) Bans on insurance coverage of abortion compound barriers to health care access for immigrant and migrant communities, which can also include logistical barriers like travel costs and distance to clinics, lodging needs and costs, childcare costs and availability, limited access to translation services, culturally competent care inclusive of low-literacy services, lost wages, and lack of paid time off for health care appointments can all delay or prohibit abortion care. (21) Nearly two out of three people live within the 100-mile border zone that allows for interior Customs and Border Protection checkpoints where immigration officers have increased discretion to detain and question individuals. (22) Immigrants of all statuses and people who are undocumented or in mixed-status families are deprived of the freedom to travel because of in-State immigration checkpoints that put them at even greater risk of criminalization, all of which contribute to a chilling effect for abortion access due to heightened threats of family separation, detention, and deportation. (23) In 2019, noncitizen immigrants aged 15 to 49 had three times the uninsured rate of naturalized citizens or people born in the United States (36 percent vs. 12 percent), and immigrants with low incomes fared worse, where in 2019 50 percent of noncitizen immigrants aged 15 to 49 with a family income below the Federal poverty level (earning less than $21,330 for a family of three) were uninsured. (24) People held in immigration detention centers who are separated from their children and families face additional barriers to abortion care because of financial barriers due to the abortion coverage bans and other restrictions. (25) On November 10, 2022, the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) issued new guidance to ensure that unaccompanied immigrant minors have access to abortion while in ORR custody awaiting reunification with family in the United States. The Federal Government should implement policies regarding the detention of pregnant, postpartum, and nursing people, to ensure that no pregnant person is detained and if such detention occurs, that there is no barrier to abortion while detained regardless of the detaining agency. (26) More than 40 percent of youth and children under age 19 and 12 percent of young people age 19 to 25 have health insurance through government programs. (27) Pregnant people younger than 18 face additional barriers to accessing abortion care. (28) Young people face parental involvement laws in 22 States where abortion is still available, or the exercise of a judicial bypass which requires minors to receive court approval to access abortion care when they do not have their parents’ knowledge or consent. (29) Judicial bypass is not a meaningful alternative but instead another hurdle faced by young people. Many minors do not know judicial bypass is available or do not know how to get it, do not have access to transportation to travel to the necessary courts, or simply are denied bypass by resistant or biased judges. (30) Abortion is one of the safest medical procedures in the country and leading public health organizations such as the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Medical Association, and the American Academy of Family Physicians strongly oppose efforts to impede access to abortion care or interfere in the relationship between a person and health care provider. (31) The 2022 Violence and Disruption Report of the National Abortion Federation found an alarming escalation in incidents of obstruction, vandalism, and trespassing at abortion clinics, with abortion providers reporting an alarming rate of death threats and threats of harm, and documented 218 incidents in 2022, a 20-percent increase in death threats and threats of harm over 2021. (32) Black, Indigenous, and other providers and patients of color face heightened levels of threats, harassment, and violence as compared to their White counterparts. (33) In the face of multifaceted attacks on their work, abortion providers remain an essential and valued part of their communities, providing high-quality, compassionate, and necessary health care. (34) There is a critical shortage of health care providers, including abortion care providers, and it is estimated that 28 percent of OB/GYN residency programs are based in States or territories that are currently enforcing abortion bans. (35) Residents desiring abortion care training living in hostile States are forced to travel to States without abortion restrictions. (36) Abortion care training residents face barriers to training including obtaining licensure and liability insurance, making it difficult for the next generation of abortion providers to provide comprehensive sexual and reproductive health care in their communities. (37) In the face of the fear and stigma following the Dobbs decision, health care facilities have denied patients lawful emergency care because of the similarities in abortion care and miscarriage management. (38) 91 facilities that provide abortion care have closed since the Supreme Court’s decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization. Of these, 62 facilities closed as a direct consequence of Dobbs and enforced or anticipated abortion bans. (39) The ability to meaningfully access abortion gives meaning to the right to abortion. (40) In the United States there is an existing support network, including abortion funds, providers, doulas, and many more, to help abortion seekers access care and navigate restrictions with expertise in providing patient-centered care. (41) Investments to improve telehealth would improve care for people with barriers to accessing in-person care, people with disabilities, and rural communities, by providing expanded autonomy and decreased barriers to access. (42) Creating more opportunities for telehealth services should not substitute building much needed capacity for high-quality, in-person care, particularly in underserved rural, low-income, and Black, Indigenous, and people of color communities. (43) Removing Federal restrictions to abortion training and investing in clinic infrastructure, including clinic security, will allow more people to provide and more people to access abortion in a safe and healthy environment and help to alleviate the drastic shortage in abortion providers. (44) Critical investments in evidence-based, patient-centered research and innovation is needed to ensure abortion care continues to meet the needs of patients across the country and will help to improve access and quality of care. 3.

Short title This Act may be cited as the Abortion is Health Care Everywhere Act of 2023 . 2. Findings Congress makes the following findings: (1) Abortion is a critical component of sexual and reproductive health care and should be accessible and affordable for all people. (2) All people have the right to make their own choices about their sexual and reproductive health, and to access quality and affordable sexual and reproductive health care. International agreements have recognized reproductive rights for over 25 years, and the 2015 Sustainable Development Goals reiterated the centrality of reproductive rights to gender equality. (3) Studies have repeatedly demonstrated that when people, including young women and adolescent girls, gender non-conforming individuals, and transgender men, are able to control their reproductive lives, there are enormous social and economic benefits—not just for the individual and their family, but for entire communities. Countries that prioritize reproductive health, rights, and justice and human rights are more likely to have better overall health throughout. (4) Health system cost is reduced when abortion is widely available and integrated with other types of health care. (5) Without access to safe abortion care, people risk their lives to end their pregnancies. At least 24,100 people in low- and middle-income countries die every year from complications from unsafe abortion. (6) Ninety-seven percent of unsafe abortions occur in developing countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. In low- and middle-income countries, the annual cost of post-abortion care for all who need it would be $4 billion. The majority of this cost is attributed to treating complications from abortions provided in unsafe conditions. (7) Restricting abortion does not reduce either the need for or number of abortions. Abortion rates are similar in countries where it is highly restricted by law and where it is broadly legal. (8) As part of their commitment to prevent unsafe abortions and preventable deaths and ensure all people have access to comprehensive sexual and reproductive health care and can exercise their right to full control over their sexuality and reproduction, developing countries and donor governments must work collaboratively to deploy funding, align policies, and mobilize expertise to make safe abortion services available to those seeking to terminate pregnancies. (9) United States law restricting United States foreign assistance funding from being used to provide safe abortion services has the effect of harming people who seek to terminate their pregnancies in several ways, including by blocking access to services and erecting barriers to providers obtaining the training and equipment needed to deliver care to those in need. (10) Since section 104(f)(1) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 ( 22 U.S.C. 2151b(f)(1) ) (commonly referred to as the Helms amendment ) was enacted in 1973, dozens of governments across the globe have liberalized abortion laws and policies. (11) In countries where the United States supports family planning and reproductive health care and in which abortion is legal on at least some grounds, support for safe abortion could avert over 19 million unsafe abortions and 17,000 maternal deaths each year. (12) When abortions are performed in accordance with the World Health Organization (WHO) guideline and standards, it is a simple and safe procedure. The most recent WHO abortion guidelines recommend the full decriminalization of abortion and removal of grounds-based restrictions on abortion. (13) The Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision goes against the global trend toward expanding access to sexual and reproductive health and rights, including abortion, and negatively impacts abortion access across the United States and globally. The decision has emboldened anti-rights actors, increased abortion stigma, and created new challenges for countries that have relied on the Roe v. Wade decision in the liberalization of their own laws. 3. Statement of policy The following shall be the policy of the United States Government: (1) Safe abortion is a critical component of comprehensive maternal and reproductive health care and should be included as part of foreign assistance programs funded by the United States Government. (2) Safe abortion is to be made widely available and integrated with other types of health care. (3) The United States Government should work to end unsafe abortion and promote safe abortion services by providing funding and collaborating with affected governments and service providers to provide training, commodities and equipment, and access to safe abortion services. 4.

Short title This Act may be cited as the Equal Access to Abortion Coverage in Health Insurance Act of 2023 or the EACH Act of 2023 . 2. Findings Congress makes the following findings: (1) All people should have access to abortion services regardless of actual or perceived race, color, ethnicity, language, ancestry, citizenship, immigration status, sex (including a sex stereotype; pregnancy, childbirth, or a related medical condition; sexual orientation or gender identity; and sex characteristics), age, disability, or sex work status or behavior. (2) A person’s income level, wealth, or type of insurance should not prevent them from having access to a full range of pregnancy-related health care, including abortion services. (3) No person should have the decision to have, or not to have, an abortion made for them based on the ability or inability to afford the health care service. (4) Since 1976, the Federal Government has banned the use of Federal funds to pay for abortion services and allows for exceptions only in very narrow circumstances. This ban affects people of reproductive age in the United States who are insured through the Medicaid program, as well as individuals who receive insurance or care through other federally funded health programs and plans. (5) Women make up the majority of Medicaid enrollees (54 percent) and, in 2019, approximately 14 million women of reproductive age relied on the program for care. Due to systematic barriers and discrimination, a disproportionately higher number of women of color and Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, or Queer (LGBTQ) individuals are enrolled in the program. (6) Women of color are more likely to be insured by the Medicaid program. Nationwide, 29 percent of Black women and 25 percent of Hispanic women aged 15–49 were enrolled in Medicaid in 2018, compared with 15 percent of White women. (7) In the aggregate, nearly one-fifth (19 percent) of Asian American and Pacific Islander women are enrolled in the Medicaid program, while enrollment rates for certain Asian ethnic subgroups are much higher (at 62 percent of Bhutanese women, 43 percent of Hmong women and 32 percent of Pakistani women). (8) Medicaid also provides coverage to more than one in four (27 percent) nonelderly American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN) adults and half of AIAN children. (9) In a 2014 nationwide survey of LGBT people with incomes less than 400 percent Federal Poverty Level (FPL), 61 percent of all respondents had incomes in the Medicaid expansion range—up to 138 percent of the FPL—including 73 percent of African-American respondents, 67 percent of Latino respondents, and 53 percent of White respondents. Another survey found that 32 percent of Asian and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander transgender people were living in poverty. (10) Of women aged 15–44 enrolled in Medicaid in 2018, 55 percent lived in the 34 States and the District of Columbia where Medicaid does not cover abortion services except in limited circumstances. This amounted to 7.2 million women of reproductive age, including 3 million women living below the FPL. Of this population, Black, Indigenous, and other People of Color (BIPOC) women accounted for 51 percent of those enrolled. (11) The Indian Health Service (IHS) is the federally funded health program for American Indians and Alaska Natives. The IHS serves a population of approximately 2.56 million and as a federally funded system, since 1988, it has been barred from providing abortion services except for very limited cases. American Indians and Alaska Natives often face higher levels of poverty and limited access to health care for a number of intersecting oppressions thus leaving them without recourse for the Federal ban on abortion services. (12) Moreover, 26 States also prohibit coverage of abortion services in the marketplaces and 11 prohibit coverage in private health insurance plans under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 ( Public Law 111–148 ). (13) A recent report details how restrictions on abortion services coverage interfere with a person’s individual decisionmaking, with their health and well-being, with their economic security, with their vulnerability to intimate partner violence, and with their constitutionally protected right to a safe and normal health care service. (14) About 25 percent of women covered by Medicaid seeking abortion services must carry their pregnancies to term because they are unable to obtain funds for their care. Government-imposed barriers to abortion services restrict people’s decisions on if, when, and how to parent, and have long-lasting and life-altering harmful effects on the pregnant person, their families and their communities. Those who seek and are denied abortion services are more likely to remain in or fall into poverty than those who access the care they need. (15) Restrictions on abortion service coverage have a disproportionately harmful impact on women with low incomes, women of color, immigrant women, LGBTQ people, and young women. Additionally, numerous state-imposed barriers make it disparately difficult for low-income people, people of color, immigrants, LGBTQ people, and young people to access the health care and resources necessary to prevent unintended pregnancy or to assure that they are able to carry healthy pregnancies to term. Furthermore, young people of reproductive age (15–24) are more likely to have a lower income than those older than that, and this income gap is greater for young BIPOC. More than 40 percent of youth and children under age 19 and almost a quarter of young people age 19 to 25 have health insurance through government programs. Without insurance coverage for abortion services, young people are at greater risk of not having the economic means to afford care outside of insurance. Young people face disproportionate access barriers to abortion including parental involvement requirement (notification and consent) and cost, in addition to barriers to contraception and inadequate and incomplete sexual(ity) education. These challenges, which are magnified for BIPOC and queer, trans, and nonbinary youth, can cause significant delays in access to needed care, and could ultimately harm the life of the young person seeking abortion services. These institutionalized barriers deny young people’s right to bodily autonomy and can force young people to encounter an abusive parent or guardian, ignores trusted relationships young people may have with adults other than a parent or legal guardian, and in the case of the judicial bypass process, may force young BIPOC to interact with a legal system that has historically targeted and caused harm to communities of color. (16) These and other government-created and government-institutionalized barriers—including the restriction on funding for abortion services in Federal programs—exacerbate and create poverty and racial inequality in income, wealth-generation, and access to services. (17) Access to health care, including abortion services, promotes the general welfare of people living in the United States. Singling out abortion services for funding restrictions in health care programs otherwise designed to promote the health and well-being of people in the United States has cost pregnant people their lives, their livelihoods, their ability to obtain or maintain economic security for themselves and their families, their ability to meet their family’s basic needs, their ability to continue their education without disruption, and their ability to break free of abusive relationships. (18) Like other health care and health insurance markets in the United States, abortion services and public insurance programs are commercial activities that affect interstate commerce. Providers and patients travel across State lines, and otherwise engage in interstate commerce, to provide and access abortion services. Material goods, services, and federally regulated medications used in abortion services circulate in interstate commerce. (19) Congress has the authority to enact this Act to ensure affordable coverage of abortion and other services pursuant to— (A) its powers under the necessary and proper clause of section 8, article I of the Constitution of the United States; (B) its powers under the commerce clause of section 8, article 1 of the Constitution of the United States; (C) its powers to tax and spend for the general welfare under section 8, article 1 of the Constitution of the United States; and (D) its powers to enforce section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment under section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. (20) Congress has exercised these constitutional powers to create, expand, and insure health care access for people in the United States for decades. Pursuant to this constitutional authority, Congress has enacted, and subsequently reauthorized, numerous health care programs including but not limited to title XVIII of the Social Security Act of 1965 (Medicare); title XIX of the Social Security Act of 1965 (Medicaid); and title XXI of the Social Security Act (Children’s Health Insurance Program, enacted in 1997). 3.

(M) The Federal Employees Health Benefit Plan under chapter 89 of title 5, United States Code.

Short title This Act may be cited as the Women’s Health Protection Act of 2023 . 2. Findings Congress finds the following: (1) Abortion services are essential health care, and access to those services is central to people’s ability to participate equally in the economic and social life of the United States. Abortion access allows people who are pregnant to make their own decisions about their pregnancies, their families, and their lives. (2) Reproductive justice requires every individual to have the right to make their own decisions about having children regardless of their circumstances and without interference and discrimination. Reproductive justice is a human right that can and will be achieved when all people, regardless of actual or perceived race, color, national origin, immigration status, sex (including gender identity, sex stereotyping, or sexual orientation), age, or disability status have the economic, social, and political power and resources to define and make decisions about their bodies, health, sexuality, families, and communities in all areas of their lives, with dignity and self-determination. (3) Abortion care, like all health care, is a human right that should not depend on one’s ZIP Code or region, age, actual or perceived race, national origin, immigration status, sex, or disability status. Unfortunately, this is the current reality for millions, creating a patchwork of abortion access across the United States. Protecting the right to determine whether to continue or end a pregnancy, and the right of health care providers to provide abortion care, is necessary and essential to achieving this human right, and ultimately reproductive justice. (4) On June 24, 2022, in its decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, the Supreme Court overruled Roe v. Wade, reversing decades of precedent recognizing a constitutional right to terminate a pregnancy before fetal viability. (5) The effects of the Dobbs decision were immediate and disastrous. In the aftermath of the Dobbs decision, many States imposed near-total bans on abortion. As of March 2023, abortion is unavailable in 14 States, leaving 17.8 million women of reproductive age (15–49) and transgender and gender nonconforming individuals with the capacity to become pregnant without abortion access in their home State. Within 100 days of the ruling, 66 clinics across 15 States were forced to stop offering abortions. (6) Travel time to an abortion clinic, already a burden for abortion seekers under Roe, has more than tripled since Dobbs. As distance to an abortion facility increases, so do the accompanying (and potentially prohibitive) burdens of time off work or school, lost wages, transportation costs, lodging, child care costs, and other ancillary costs. (7) Even before the Dobbs decision, access to abortion services had long been obstructed across the United States in various ways, including: prohibitions of, and restrictions on, insurance coverage; mandatory parental involvement laws; restrictions that shame and stigmatize people seeking abortion services; and medically unnecessary regulations that fail to further the safety of abortion services, but instead cause harm people by delaying, complicating access to, and reducing the availability of, abortion services. (8) Being denied an abortion can have serious consequences for people’s physical, mental, and economic health and well-being, and that of their families. According to the Turnaway Study, a longitudinal study published by Advancing New Standards In Reproductive Health (ANSIRH) in 2019, individuals who are denied a wanted abortion are more likely to experience economic insecurity than individuals who receive a wanted abortion. After following participants for five years, the study found that people who were denied abortion care were more likely to live in poverty, experience debt, and have lower credit scores for several years after the denial. These findings demonstrate that when people have control over when to have children and how many children to have, their children benefit through increased economic security and better maternal bonding. (9) Abortion bans and restrictions have repercussions for a broad range of health care beyond pregnancy termination, including exacerbating the existing maternal health crisis facing the United States. The United States has the highest maternal mortality rate of any industrialized nations, and Black women and birthing people face three times the risk of dying from pregnancy related causes as their white counterparts. Even prior to Dobbs, research found that States that enacted abortion restrictions based on gestation increased their maternal mortality rate by 38 percent. Research has found that a nationwide ban would increase the United States maternal mortality rate by an additional 24 percent. Furthermore, States that have banned, are planning to ban, or have severely restricted abortion care have fewer maternal health providers, more maternity care deserts, higher rates of both maternal and infant mortality, and greater racial inequity in health care. (10) Abortion bans and restrictions additionally harm people’s health by reducing access to other essential health care services offered by many of the providers targeted by the restrictions, including— (A) screenings and preventive services, including contraceptive services; (B) testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections; (C) LGBTQ health services; and (D) referrals for primary care, intimate partner violence prevention, prenatal care, and adoption services. (11) This ripple effect has only worsened since the Dobbs decision. Clinicians and pharmacists have denied access to essential medication for conditions including gastric ulcers and autoimmune diseases because those drugs are also used for medication abortion care. Patients are reporting being denied or delayed in their receipt of necessary and potentially lifesaving treatment for ectopic pregnancies and miscarriage management because of the newfound legal risks facing providers. (12) Reproductive justice seeks to address restrictions on reproductive health, including abortion, that perpetuate systems of oppression, lack of bodily autonomy, white supremacy, and anti-Black racism. This violent legacy has manifested in policies including enslavement, rape, and experimentation on Black women; forced sterilizations, medical experimentation on low-income women’s reproductive systems; and the forcible removal of Indigenous children. Access to equitable reproductive health care, including abortion services, has always been deficient in the United States for Black, Indigenous, Latina/x, Asian American and Pacific Islander, and People of Color (BIPOC) and their families. (13) The legacy of restrictions on reproductive health, rights, and justice is not a dated vestige of a dark history. Data show the harms of abortion-specific restrictions fall especially heavily on people with low incomes, people of color, immigrants, young people, people with disabilities, and those living in rural and other medically underserved areas. Abortion bans and restrictions are compounded further by the ongoing criminalization of people who are pregnant, including those who are incarcerated, living with HIV, or with substance-use disorders. These populations already experience health disparities due to social, political, and environmental inequities, and restrictions on abortion services exacerbate these harms. Removing bans and restrictions on abortion services would constitute one important step on the path toward realizing reproductive justice by ensuring that the full range of reproductive health care is accessible to all who need it. (14) Abortion bans and restrictions are tools of gender oppression, as they target health care services that are used primarily by women. These paternalistic bans and restrictions rely on and reinforce harmful stereotypes about gender roles and women’s decisionmaking, undermining their ability to control their own lives and well-being. These restrictions harm the basic autonomy, dignity, and equality of women. (15) The terms woman and women are used in this bill to reflect the identity of the majority of people targeted and most directly affected by bans and restrictions on abortion services, which are rooted in misogyny. However, access to abortion services is critical to the health of every person capable of becoming pregnant. This Act is intended to protect all people with the capacity for pregnancy—cisgender women, transgender men, nonbinary individuals, those who identify with a different gender, and others—who are unjustly harmed by restrictions on abortion services. (16) Pregnant individuals will continue to experience a range of pregnancy outcomes, including abortion, miscarriage, stillbirths, and infant losses regardless of how the State attempts to exert power over their reproductive decisionmaking, and will continue to need support for their health and well-being through their reproductive lifespans. (17) Evidence from the United States and around the globe bears out that criminalizing abortion invariably leads to arrests, investigations, and imprisonment of people who end their pregnancies or experience pregnancy loss, leading to violations of fundamental rights to liberty, dignity, bodily autonomy, equality, due process, privacy, health, and freedom from cruel and inhumane treatment. (18) All major experts in public health and medicine such as the American Medical Association, American Public Health Association, American Academy of Pediatrics, American Society of Addiction Medicine, and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, oppose the criminalization of pregnancy outcomes because the threat of being subject to investigation or punishment through the criminal legal system when seeking health care threatens pregnant people’s lives and undermines public health by deterring people from seeking care for obstetrical emergencies. (19) Antiabortion stigma that is compounded by abortion bans and restrictions also contributes to violence and harassment that put both people seeking and people providing abortion care at risk. From 1977 to 2021, there were 11 murders, 42 bombings, 196 acts of arson, 491 assaults, and thousands of other incidents of criminal activity directed at abortion seekers, providers, volunteers, and clinic staff. This violence existed under Roe and has been steadily escalating for years. The presence of dangerous protestors and organized extremists acts as yet another barrier to abortion care, and this threat has become even more urgent as abortion bans proliferate and stigma around abortion care increases. (20) Abortion is one of the safest medical procedures in the United States. An independent, comprehensive review of the state of science on the safety and quality of abortion services, published by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine in 2018, found that abortion in the United States is safe and effective and that the biggest threats to the quality of abortion services in the United States are State regulations that create barriers to care. Such abortion-specific restrictions, as well as broader State bans, conflict with medical standards and are not supported by the recommendations and guidelines issued by leading reproductive health care professional organizations including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the Society of Family Planning, the National Abortion Federation, the World Health Organization, and others. (21) For over 20 years, medication abortion care has been available in the United States as a safe, effective, Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved treatment to end an early pregnancy. Today, medication abortion care accounts for more than half of all pregnancy terminations in the United States; however, significant barriers to access remain in place, particularly in States that have imposed onerous restrictions that conflict with FDA’s regulation of medication abortion. Additionally, opponents of abortion are now deploying new tactics to limit access to this FDA-approved medication that would set a dangerous precedent for the Federal regulation of medication products and have national repercussions. (22) Health care providers are subject to licensing laws in various jurisdictions, which are not affected by this Act except as expressly provided in this Act. (23) International human rights law recognizes that access to abortion is intrinsically linked to the rights to life, health, equality and nondiscrimination, privacy, and freedom from ill treatment. United Nations (UN) human rights treaty monitoring bodies have found that legal abortion services, like other reproductive health care services, must be available, accessible, affordable, acceptable, and of good quality. UN human rights treaty bodies have condemned criminalization of abortion and medically unnecessary barriers to abortion services, including mandatory waiting periods, biased counseling requirements, and third-party authorization requirements. (24) Core human rights treaties ratified by the United States protect access to abortion. For example, in 2018, the UN Human Rights Committee, which oversees implementation of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), made clear that the right to life, enshrined in Article 6 of the ICCPR, at a minimum requires governments to provide safe, legal, and effective access to abortion where a person’s life and health are at risk, or when carrying a pregnancy to term would otherwise cause substantial pain or suffering. The Committee stated that governments must not impose restrictions on abortion which subject women and girls to physical or mental pain or suffering, discriminate against them, arbitrarily interfere with their privacy, or place them at risk of undertaking unsafe abortions. The Committee stated that governments should not apply criminal sanctions to women and girls who undergo abortion or to medical service providers who assist them in doing so. Furthermore, the Committee stated that governments should remove existing barriers that deny effective access to safe and legal abortion, refrain from introducing new barriers to abortion, and prevent the stigmatization of those seeking abortion. (25) International human rights experts have condemned the Dobbs decision and regression on abortion rights in the United States more generally as a violation of human rights. Immediately upon release of the decision, then-UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet reiterated human rights protections for abortion and the impact that the decision will have on the fundamental rights of millions within the United States, particularly people with low incomes and people belonging to racial and ethnic minorities. UN independent human rights experts, including the UN Working Group on discrimination against women and girls, the UN Special Rapporteur on the right to health, and the UN Special Rapporteur on violence against women and girls, similarly denounced the decision. At the conclusion of a human rights review of the United States in August 2022, the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination noted deep concerns with the Dobbs decision and recommended that the United States address the disparate impact that it will have on racial and ethnic minorities, Indigenous women, and those with low incomes. (26) Abortion bans and restrictions affect the cost and availability of abortion services, and the settings in which abortion services are delivered. People travel across State lines and otherwise engage in interstate commerce to access this essential medical care. Likewise, health care providers travel across State lines and otherwise engage in interstate commerce in order to provide abortion services to patients, and more would be forced to do so absent this Act. (27) Legal limitations and requirements imposed upon health care providers or their patients invariably affect commerce over which the United States has jurisdiction. Health care providers engage in a form of economic and commercial activity when they provide abortion services, and there is an interstate market for abortion services. (28) Abortion bans and restrictions substantially affect interstate commerce in numerous ways. For example, to provide abortion services, health care providers engage in interstate commerce to purchase medicine, medical equipment, and other necessary goods and services. To provide and assist others in providing abortion services, health care providers engage in interstate commerce to obtain and provide training. To provide abortion services, health care providers employ and obtain commercial services from doctors, nurses, and other personnel who engage in interstate commerce, including by and traveling across State lines. (29) Congress has the authority to enact this Act to protect access to abortion services pursuant to— (A) its powers under the commerce clause of section 8 of article I of the Constitution of the United States; (B) its powers under section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States to enforce the provisions of section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment; and (C) its powers under the necessary and proper clause of section 8 of article I of the Constitution of the United States. (30) Congress has used its authority in the past to protect access to abortion services and health care providers’ ability to provide abortion services. In the early 1990s, protests and blockades at health care facilities where abortion services were provided, and associated violence, increased dramatically and reached crisis level, requiring congressional action. Congress passed the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act ( Public Law 103–259 ; 108 Stat. 694) to address that situation and protect physical access to abortion services. (31) Congressional action is necessary to put an end to harmful restrictions, to protect access to abortion services for everyone regardless of where they live, to protect the ability of health care providers to provide these services in a safe and accessible manner, and to eliminate unwarranted burdens on commerce and the right to travel. 3. Purpose The purposes of this Act are as follows: (1) To permit people to seek and obtain abortion services, and to permit health care providers to provide abortion services, without harmful or unwarranted limitations or requirements that single out the provision of abortion services for restrictions that are more burdensome than those restrictions imposed on medically comparable procedures, do not significantly advance reproductive health or the safety of abortion services, or make abortion services more difficult to access. (2) To promote access to abortion services and thereby protect women’s ability to participate equally in the economic and social life of the United States. (3) To protect people’s ability to make decisions about their bodies, medical care, family, and life’s course. (4) To eliminate unwarranted burdens on commerce and the right to travel. Abortion bans and restrictions invariably affect commerce over which the United States has jurisdiction. Health care providers engage in economic and commercial activity when they provide abortion services. Moreover, there is an interstate market for abortion services and, in order to provide such services, health care providers engage in interstate commerce to purchase medicine, medical equipment, and other necessary goods and services; to obtain and provide training; and to employ and obtain commercial services from health care personnel, many of whom themselves engage in interstate commerce, including by traveling across State lines. Congress has the authority to enact this Act to protect access to abortion services pursuant to— (A) its powers under the commerce clause of section 8 of article I of the Constitution of the United States; (B) its powers under section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States to enforce the provisions of section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment; and (C) its powers under the necessary and proper clause of section 8 of article I of the Constitution of the United States. 4. Definitions In this Act: (1) Abortion services The term abortion services means an abortion and any medical or non-medical services related to and provided in conjunction with an abortion (whether or not provided at the same time or on the same day as the abortion). (2) Government The term government includes each branch, department, agency, instrumentality, and official of the United States or a State. (3) Health care provider The term health care provider means any entity (including any hospital, clinic, or pharmacy) or individual (including any physician, certified nurse-midwife, nurse practitioner, pharmacist, or physician assistant) that— (A) is engaged or seeks to engage in the delivery of health care services, including abortion services; and (B) if required by law or regulation to be licensed or certified to engage in the delivery of such services— (i) is so licensed or certified; or (ii) would be so licensed or certified but for their past, present, or potential provision of abortion services protected by section 4. (4) Medically comparable procedures The term medically comparable procedures means medical procedures that are similar in terms of health and safety risks to the patient, complexity, or the clinical setting that is indicated. (5) Pregnancy The term pregnancy refers to the period of the human reproductive process beginning with the implantation of a fertilized egg. (6) State The term State includes the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and each territory and possession of the United States, and any subdivision of any of the foregoing, including any unit of local government, such as a county, city, town, village, or other general purpose political subdivision of a State. (7) Viability The term viability means the point in a pregnancy at which, in the good-faith medical judgment of the treating health care provider, and based on the particular facts of the case before the health care provider, there is a reasonable likelihood of sustained fetal survival outside the uterus with or without artificial support. 5. Protected activities and services (a) General rules (1) Pre-viability A health care provider has a right under this Act to provide abortion services, and a patient has a corresponding right under this Act to terminate a pregnancy prior to viability without being subject to any of the following limitations or requirements: (A) A prohibition on abortion prior to viability, including a prohibition or restriction on a particular abortion procedure or method, or a prohibition on providing or obtaining such abortions. (B) A limitation on a health care provider’s ability to prescribe or dispense drugs that could be used for reproductive health purposes based on current evidence-based regimens or the provider’s good-faith medical judgment, or a limitation on a patient’s ability to receive or use such drugs, other than a limitation generally applicable to the prescription, dispensing, or distribution of drugs. (C) A limitation on a health care provider’s ability to provide, or a patient’s ability to receive, abortion services via telemedicine, other than a limitation generally applicable to the provision of medically comparable services via telemedicine. (D) A limitation or prohibition on a patient’s ability to receive, or a provider’s ability to provide, abortion services in a State based on the State of residency of the patient, or a prohibition or limitation on the ability of any individual to assist or support a patient seeking abortion. (E) A requirement that a health care provider perform specific tests or medical procedures in connection with the provision of abortion services (including prior to or subsequent to the abortion), unless generally required for the provision of medically comparable procedures. (F) A requirement that a health care provider offer or provide a patient seeking abortion services medically inaccurate information. (G) A limitation or requirement concerning the physical plant, equipment, staffing, or hospital transfer arrangements of facilities where abortion services are provided, or the credentials or hospital privileges or status of personnel at such facilities, that is not imposed on facilities or the personnel of facilities where medically comparable procedures are performed. (H) A requirement that, prior to obtaining an abortion, a patient make one or more medically unnecessary in-person visits to the provider of abortion services or to any individual or entity that does not provide abortion services. (I) A limitation on a health care provider’s ability to provide immediate abortion services when that health care provider believes, based on the good-faith medical judgment of the provider, that delay would pose a risk to the patient’s life or health. (J) A requirement that a patient seeking abortion services at any point or points in time prior to viability disclose the patient’s reason or reasons for seeking abortion services, or a limitation on providing or obtaining abortion services at any point or points in time prior to viability based on any actual, perceived, or potential reason or reasons of the patient for obtaining abortion services, regardless of whether the limitation is based on a health care provider’s actual or constructive knowledge of such reason or reasons. (2) Post-viability (A) In general A health care provider has a right under this Act to provide abortion services and a patient has a corresponding right under this Act to terminate a pregnancy after viability when, in the good-faith medical judgement of the treating health care provider, it is necessary to protect the life or health of the patient. This subparagraph shall not otherwise apply after viability. (B) Additional circumstances A State may provide additional circumstances under which post viability abortions are permitted under this paragraph. (C) Limitation In the case where a termination of a pregnancy after viability, in the good-faith medical judgement of the treating health care provider, is necessary to protect the life or health of the patient, a State shall not impose any of the limitations or requirements described in paragraph (1). (b) Other limitations or requirements The rights described in subsection (a) shall not be limited or otherwise infringed through any other limitation or requirement that— (1) expressly, effectively, implicitly, or as implemented, singles out abortion, the provision of abortion services, individuals who seek abortion services or who provide assistance and support to those seeking abortion services, health care providers who provide abortion services, or facilities in which abortion services are provided; and (2) impedes access to abortion services. (c) Factors for consideration A court may consider the following factors, among others, in determining whether a limitation or requirement impedes access to abortion services for purposes of subsection (b)(2): (1) Whether the limitation or requirement, in a provider’s good-faith medical judgment, interferes with a health care provider’s ability to provide care and render services, or poses a risk to the patient’s health or safety. (2) Whether the limitation or requirement is reasonably likely to delay or deter a patient in accessing abortion services. (3) Whether the limitation or requirement is reasonably likely to directly or indirectly increase the cost of providing abortion services or the cost for obtaining abortion services such as costs associated with travel, childcare, or time off work. (4) Whether the limitation or requirement is reasonably likely to have the effect of necessitating patient travel that would not otherwise have been required, including by making it necessary for a patient to travel out of State to obtain services. (5) Whether the limitation or requirement is reasonably likely to result in a decrease in the availability of abortion services in a given State or geographic region. (6) Whether the limitation or requirement imposes penalties that are not imposed on other health care providers for comparable conduct or failure to act, or that are more severe than penalties imposed on other health care providers for comparable conduct or failure to act. (7) The cumulative impact of the limitation or requirement combined with other limitations or requirements. (d) Exception To defend against a claim that a limitation or requirement violates a health care provider’s or patient’s rights under subsection (b) a party must establish, by clear and convincing evidence, that the limitation or requirement is essential to significantly advance the safety of abortion services or the health of patients and that the safety or health objective cannot be accomplished by a different means that does not interfere with the right protected under subsection (b). 6. Protection of the right to travel A person has a fundamental right under the Constitution of the United States and this Act to travel to a State other than the person’s State of residence, including to obtain reproductive health services such as prenatal, childbirth, fertility, and abortion services, and a person has a right under this Act to assist another person to obtain such services or otherwise exercise the right described in this section. 7. Applicability and preemption (a) In general (1) Superseding inconsistent laws Except as provided under subsection (b), this Act shall supersede any inconsistent Federal or State law, and the implementation of such law, whether statutory, common law, or otherwise, and whether adopted prior to or after the date of enactment of this Act. A Federal or State government official shall not administer, implement, or enforce any law, rule, regulation, standard, or other provision having the force and effect of law that conflicts with any provision of this Act, notwithstanding any other provision of Federal law, including the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 ( 42 U.S.C. 2000bb et seq. ). (2) Laws after date of enactment Federal law enacted after the date of the enactment of this Act shall be subject to this Act unless such law explicitly excludes such application by reference to this Act. (b) Limitations The provisions of this Act shall not supersede or apply to— (1) laws regulating physical access to clinic entrances; (2) laws regulating insurance or medical assistance coverage of abortion services; (3) the procedure described in section 1531(b)(1) of title 18, United States Code; or (4) generally applicable State contract law. (c) Preemption defense In any legal or administrative action against a person or entity who has exercised or attempted to exercise a right protected by section 4 or section 5 or against any person or entity who has taken any step to assist any such person or entity in exercising such right, this Act shall also apply to, and may be raised as a defense by, such person or entity, in addition to the remedies specified in section 8. 8. Rules of construction (a) Liberal construction by courts In any action before a court under this Act, the court shall liberally construe the provisions of this Act to effectuate the purposes of the Act. (b) Protection of life and health Nothing in this Act shall be construed to authorize any government official to interfere with, diminish, or negatively affect a person’s ability to obtain or provide abortion services prior to viability, or after viability when, in the good-faith medical judgment of the treating health care provider, continuation of the pregnancy would pose a risk to the pregnant patient’s life or health. (c) Government officials Any person who, by operation of a provision of Federal or State law, is permitted to implement or enforce a limitation or requirement that violates section 4 or 5 shall be considered a government official for purposes of this Act. 9. Enforcement (a) Attorney general The Attorney General may commence a civil action on behalf of the United States in any district court of the United States against any State that violates, or against any government official (including a person described in section 7(c)) who implements or enforces a limitation or requirement that violates, section 4 or 5. The court shall declare unlawful the limitation or requirement if it is determined to be in violation of this Act. (b) Private right of action (1) In general Any individual or entity adversely affected by an alleged violation of this Act, including any person or health care provider, may commence a civil action against any government official (including a person described in section 7(c)) that implements or enforces a limitation or requirement that violates, section 4 or 5. The court shall declare unlawful the limitation or requirement if it is determined to be in violation of this Act. (2) Health care provider A health care provider may commence an action for relief on its own behalf, on behalf of the provider’s staff, and on behalf of the provider’s patients who are or may be adversely affected by an alleged violation of this Act. (c) Pre-Enforcement challenges A suit under subsection (a) or (b) may be brought to prevent enforcement or implementation by any government of a State limitation or requirement that is inconsistent with section 4 or 5. (d) Declaratory and equitable relief In any action under this section, the court may award appropriate declaratory and equitable relief, including temporary, preliminary, or permanent injunctive relief. (e) Costs In any action under this section, the court shall award costs of litigation, as well as reasonable attorney’s fees, to any prevailing plaintiff. A plaintiff shall not be liable to a defendant for costs or attorney’s fees in any non-frivolous action under this section. (f) Jurisdiction The district courts of the United States shall have jurisdiction over proceedings under this Act and shall exercise the same without regard to whether the party aggrieved shall have exhausted any administrative or other remedies that may be provided for by law. (g) Abrogation of state immunity Neither a State that enforces or maintains, nor a government official (including a person described in section 7(c)) who is permitted to implement or enforce any limitation or requirement that violates section 4 or 5 shall be immune under the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, the Eleventh Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, or any other source of law, from an action in a Federal or State court of competent jurisdiction challenging that limitation or requirement, unless such immunity is required by clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States. 10. Effective date This Act shall take effect upon the date of enactment of this Act. 11. Severability If any provision of this Act, or the application of such provision to any person, entity, government, or circumstance, is held to be unconstitutional, the remainder of this Act, or the application of such provision to all other persons, entities, governments, or circumstances, shall not be affected thereby. 118 HR 782 IH: Ensuring Women’s Right to Reproductive Freedom Act U.S. House of Representatives 2023-02-02 text/xml EN Pursuant to Title 17 Section 105 of the United States Code, this file is not subject to copyright protection and is in the public domain.

Short title This Act may be cited as the Ensuring Women’s Right to Reproductive Freedom Act . 2. Interference with interstate abortion services prohibited (a) Interference prohibited No person acting under color of State law, including any person who, by operation of a provision of State law, is permitted to implement or enforce State law, may prevent, restrict, or impede, or retaliate against, in any manner— (1) a health care provider’s ability to provide, initiate, or otherwise enable an abortion service that is lawful in the State in which the service is to be provided to a patient who does not reside in that State; (2) any person or entity’s ability to assist a health care provider to provide, initiate, or otherwise enable an abortion service that is lawful in the State in which the service is to be provided to a patient who does not reside in that State, if such assistance does not violate the law of that State; (3) any person’s ability to travel across a State line for the purpose of obtaining an abortion service that is lawful in the State in which the service is to be provided; (4) any person’s or entity’s ability to assist another person traveling across a State line for the purpose of obtaining an abortion service that is lawful in the State in which the service is to be provided; or (5) the movement in interstate commerce, in accordance with Federal law or regulation, of any drug approved or licensed by the Food and Drug Administration for the termination of a pregnancy. (b) Enforcement by Attorney General The Attorney General may bring a civil action in the appropriate United States district court against any person who violates subsection (a) for declaratory and injunctive relief. (c) Private right of action Any person who is harmed by a violation of subsection (a) may bring a civil action in the appropriate United States district court against the person who violated such subsection for declaratory and injunctive relief, and for such compensatory damages as the court determines appropriate, including for economic losses and for emotional pain and suffering. The court may, in addition, award reasonable attorney’s fees and costs of the action to a prevailing plaintiff. (d) Definitions In this section: (1) The term abortion service means— (A) an abortion, including the use of any drug approved or licensed by the Food and Drug Administration for the termination of a pregnancy; and (B) any health care service related to or provided in conjunction with an abortion (whether or not provided at the same time or on the same day as the abortion). (2) The term health care provider means any entity or individual (including any physician, certified nurse-midwife, nurse practitioner, physician’s assistant, or pharmacist) that is— (A) engaged or seeks to engage in the delivery of health care services, including abortion services; and (B) licensed or certified to perform such service under applicable State law. (3) The term drug has the meaning given such term in section 201 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act ( 21 U.S.C. 321 ).

I 118th CONGRESS 1st Session H. R. 2736 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES April 20, 2023 Ms. Bonamici (for herself, Mrs. Sykes , Mrs. Trahan , Mr. Grijalva , Ms. Titus , Mr. Takano , Ms. Porter , Mr. Veasey , Ms. Williams of Georgia , Ms. Lee of Pennsylvania , Mr. Evans , Ms. Pingree , Ms. Wasserman Schultz , Mrs. Fletcher , Mrs. Watson Coleman , Ms. Kuster , Mr. Bowman , Mr. Connolly , Ms. Budzinski , Mr. García of Illinois , Ms. Lois Frankel of Florida , Ms. Crockett , Ms. Scanlon , Ms. DelBene , Ms. McCollum , Mr. Gottheimer , Ms. Adams , Ms. Escobar , Ms. Chu , Mrs. McClellan , Ms. DeGette , Ms. Norton , Ms. Jacobs , Ms. Tlaib , Mr. Pocan , Ms. Matsui , Mr. Huffman , Ms. Lee of California , Ms. Tokuda , Ms. Balint , Mr. Allred , Mrs. Hayes , Ms. Salinas , Ms. Velázquez , Mr. Auchincloss , and Ms. Jayapal ) introduced the following bill; which was referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce A BILL To prohibit disinformation in the advertising of abortion services, and for other purposes. 1. Short title This Act may be cited as the Stop Antiabortion Disinformation Act or the SAD Act . 2. Findings Congress finds the following: (1) Abortion services are an essential component of reproductive health care. (2) On June 24, 2022, in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, the Supreme Court overruled Roe v. Wade, reversing decades of precedent recognizing a constitutional right to abortion and permitting decimation of an already precarious landscape of access to abortion. (3) The effects were immediate and disastrous. As of January 2023, abortion is unavailable in 14 States, leaving 17.8 million women of reproductive age (ages 15 to 49) and transgender and gender nonconforming individuals without access to abortion in the home State of such individuals. (4) Travel time to an abortion clinic, already burdensome under Roe, has more than tripled since the Dobbs decision, as scores of clinics in already underserved areas have been forced to close and more patients have been forced to travel to other States. As distance to an abortion facility increases, so do the accompanying burdens of time off from work or school, lost wages, transportation costs, lodging, child care costs, and other ancillary costs. (5) The freedom to decide whether and when to have a child is key to the ability of an individual to participate fully in our democracy. (6) Crisis pregnancy centers (CPCs) are antiabortion organizations that present themselves as comprehensive reproductive health care providers with the intent of discouraging pregnant people from having abortions. (7) According to the Journal of Medical Internet Research (JMIR) Public Health and Surveillance, there are more than 2,500 CPCs in the United States, though some antiabortion groups claim that the number is closer to 4,000. (8) According to 2020 data from JMIR Public Health and Surveillance, on average, CPCs outnumber abortion clinics nationwide by an average of 3 to 1. In some States, this statistic is higher. For example, The Alliance: State Advocates for Women’s Rights & Gender Equality (The Alliance) found that in Pennsylvania, CPCs outnumber abortion clinics by 9 to 1. The Alliance also found that in Minnesota, CPCs outnumber abortion clinics by 11 to 1. (9) CPCs routinely engage in a variety of deceptive tactics, including making false claims about reproductive health care and providers, disseminating inaccurate, misleading, and stigmatizing information about the risks of abortion and contraception, and using illegitimate or false citations to imply that deceptive claims are supported by legitimate medical sources. (10) CPCs typically advertise themselves as providers of comprehensive health care. However, most CPCs in the United States do not employ licensed medical personnel or provide referrals for birth control or abortion care. (11) By using these deceptive tactics, CPCs prevent people from accessing reproductive health care and intentionally delay access to time-sensitive abortion services. The harm of these delays is far greater in the wake of the Dobbs decision. (12) CPCs target underresourced neighborhoods and communities of color, including Black, Latino, Indigenous, Asian-American, Pacific Islander, and immigrant communities, by locating their facilities near social services centers and comprehensive reproductive health care providers. CPCs place advertisements in these neighborhoods that mislead and draw people away from nearby providers that offer evidence-based sexual and reproductive health care, including abortion care. This exacerbates existing health barriers and delays access to time-sensitive care. (13) People are entitled to honest, accurate, and timely information when seeking reproductive health care. 3. Prohibition on disinformation of abortion services (a) Conduct prohibited (1) Prohibition It shall be unlawful for any person to engage in deceptive advertising about the reproductive health services offered by the person, including advertising that deceptively states that the person— (A) offers or provides contraception or abortion services (or referrals for such contraception or abortion services); or (B) employs or offers access to licensed medical personnel. (2) Rulemaking The Commission may promulgate regulations under section 553 of title 5, United States Code, to implement this section. (3) Enforcement by the Commission A violation of this section or a regulation promulgated under this section shall be treated as a violation of a regulation under section 18(a)(1)(B) of the Federal Trade Commission Act ( 15 U.S.C. 57a(a)(1)(B) ) regarding unfair or deceptive acts or practices. Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (4) to (6), the Commission shall enforce this section and the regulations promulgated under this section in the same manner, by the same means, and with the same jurisdiction, powers, and duties as though all applicable terms and provisions of the Federal Trade Commission Act were incorporated into and made a part of this section.

(5) Civil penalty In addition to any other penalty as may be prescribed by law, any person who violates this section or a regulation promulgated under this section shall be punishable by a civil penalty that shall not exceed the greater of— (A) $100,000; or (B) 50 percent of the revenues earned by the ultimate parent entity of a person during the preceding 12-month period. (6) Independent litigation authority (A) Civil action by Commission If the Commission has reason to believe that a person has violated this section or a regulation promulgated under this section, the Commission may bring a civil action in any appropriate United States district court for any of the following remedies: (i) To enjoin any further such violation by such person.

The Commission shall inform the Attorney General of the exercise of such authority, and such exercise shall not preclude the Attorney General from intervening on behalf of the United States in such action and any appeal of such action as may be otherwise provided by law. (b) Reports Beginning 1 year after the date of the enactment of this Act, and every 2 years thereafter, the Commission shall submit to Congress a report that includes, with respect to the previous year, a description of any enforcement action by the Commission under this Act, any regulation promulgated under this Act, and the outcomes of such actions.

(2) Commission The term Commission means the Federal Trade Commission. (3) Person The term person has the meaning given that term in section 551(2) of title 5, United States Code. 118 HR 6357 IH: Access to Reproductive Care for Servicemembers Act U.S. House of Representatives 2023-11-09 text/xml EN Pursuant to Title 17 Section 105 of the United States Code, this file is not subject to copyright protection and is in the public domain. I 118th CONGRESS 1st Session H. R. 6357 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES November 9, 2023 Ms. Sherrill (for herself, Ms. Houlahan , Ms. Escobar , Mr. Crow , Mr. Smith of Washington , Mr. Courtney , Mr. Garamendi , Mr. Norcross , Mr. Gallego , Mr. Moulton , Mr. Carbajal , Mr. Khanna , Mr. Keating , Mr. Kim of New Jersey , Ms. Slotkin , Mr. Golden of Maine , Ms. Jacobs , Ms. Strickland , Mr. Ryan , Mr. Jackson of North Carolina , Mr. Vasquez , Mr. Deluzio , Ms. Tokuda , Ms. McClellan , Ms. Sewell , Mr. Horsford , and Mr. Panetta ) introduced the following bill; which was referred to the Committee on Armed Services A BILL To establish leave policies of the Armed Forces for a member to seek an abortion. 1. Short title This Act may be cited as the Access to Reproductive Care for Servicemembers Act . 2. Findings Congress finds the following: (1) Following the Supreme Court’s decision to eliminate the right to abortion, States across the country have moved swiftly to ban abortion access, leading to even greater barriers to care for military families. (2) Access to abortion care is essential to a person’s health and central to their economic and social well-being. Bans and restrictions on abortion delay access to abortion care and therefore increase costs for members of the Armed Forces seeking care. The consequence of these delays and barriers could mean that a person is forced to carry a pregnancy against their will, which can greatly affect their bodily autonomy, financial stability, and overall well-being. (3) The Armed Forces have a large presence in many States poised to ban or restrict access to abortion, many of which also neighbor States that would likely ban abortion. (4) Members of the Armed Forces seeking care off-base may be limited in their ability to do so due to restrictions on leave or travel restrictions imposed by their unit. (5) Restrictions on receiving approval to take leave for abortion care interfere with a member of the Armed Forces’ health, well-being, and right to access the care they need. The decision to terminate a pregnancy should not depend on the discretion or judgment of a military commander. (6) The Secretary of Defense has recognized that abortion is a time sensitive-procedure and access should not be delayed for members or military families. (7) When a member of the Armed Forces decides to obtain an abortion, it should be available, affordable, private, and free from punishment, reprisal, or judgment by the member’s chain of command. (8) Commanders or approval authorities have a duty to display objectivity, compassion, and discretion when addressing all health care matters, including reproductive health care matters, and to enforce existing policies against discrimination and retaliation. (9) The harms of abortion-specific restrictions fall most heavily on people who already face barriers to accessing health care including people with low incomes, such as junior members, and Black, Indigenous, and people of color, immigrants, young people, people with disabilities, the LGBTQI+ community, and those stationed in rural and other medically underserved areas. (10) Equal access to abortion care, everywhere, is essential to social and economic participation, equality, reproductive autonomy, and the right to determine a person’s own life and future. (11) The denial of leave for an abortion or any other reproductive health service violates the rights of members of the Armed Forces. Access to care for military families should not be determined by the personal beliefs of others. (12) In addition to the health and well-being implications for members of the Armed Forces and their families, the failure to address these issues will contribute to the challenges that the Armed Forces faces in attracting and retaining personnel, thereby negatively affecting military strength and readiness. 3. Leave for a member of the Armed Forces for abortion (a) In general The Secretary concerned (as such term is defined in section 101 of title 10, United States Code) shall, with regards to abortion care for a member of the Armed Forces or the dependent of such a member— (1) consider such care to be time-sensitive and therefore approve leave for such abortion care; and (2) not require the member or dependent to disclose to a commanding officer the time-sensitive care or procedure being received during such leave. (b) Reimbursement for travel The Secretary concerned shall reimburse a member or dependent of a member for costs incurred to travel to a clinic that provides abortion care and services if timely access to abortion services is not available near the member or dependent’s location. (c) Privacy Health care providers of the Defense Health Agency and commanding officers shall, to the greatest extent practicable, protect the privacy of a member who takes leave under this section, including when such member makes a request for such leave and when such member returns to duty. (d) Prohibition No member of the Armed Forces may be subject to any adverse action for requesting, taking, or granting leave under this section. 118 HR 4796 IH: Reproductive Health Patient Navigator Act of 2023 U.S. House of Representatives 2023-07-20 text/xml EN Pursuant to Title 17 Section 105 of the United States Code, this file is not subject to copyright protection and is in the public domain. I 118th CONGRESS 1st Session H. R. 4796 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES July 20, 2023 Ms. Lee of Nevada (for herself, Ms. Blunt Rochester , Mr. Carter of Louisiana , Mr. Connolly , Ms. Crockett , Mr. Evans , Mr. Gottheimer , Mr. Grijalva , Mr. Huffman , Ms. Kamlager-Dove , Mr. Lieu , Mrs. McClellan , Mr. Schiff , Ms. Titus , Ms. Tokuda , Mr. Trone , Ms. Williams of Georgia , Ms. Norton , Ms. Barragán , Mr. Landsman , Mr. Johnson of Georgia , Ms. Wilson of Florida , Mrs. Watson Coleman , Mrs. Fletcher , Mr. Casten , Ms. Sewell , Mr. Soto , Mr. Horsford , Mr. Panetta , Ms. Jackson Lee , Ms. Clarke of New York , Ms. Spanberger , Mrs. Sykes , and Mrs. Hayes ) introduced the following bill; which was referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce A BILL To establish a grant program to fund reproductive health patient navigators for individuals seeking abortion services. 1. Short title This Act may be cited as the Reproductive Health Patient Navigator Act of 2023 . 2. Findings Congress finds as follows: (1) As the legal hurdles to abortion services increase, so does the complexity of navigating access to these essential reproductive health services. (2) Community-based organizations like abortion funds are connecting people to abortions, by working with individuals to navigate an ever-evolving landscape of reproductive health care. (3) Abortion funds have been helping individuals navigate the complexity of abortion services for decades and are well placed to lead patient navigation programs. 3. Establishment of grant program for reproductive health patient navigators Subpart V of part D of title III of the Public Health Service Act ( 42 U.S.C. 256 et seq. ) is amended by adding at the end the following: 340A–1.

(5) Providing individuals seeking abortion services with unbiased and medically and factually accurate reproductive health information to support individuals' informed decision-making. (6) Developing partnerships with local community organizations providing services for which eligible entity provides assistance, abortion service providers, and other patient navigators, such as patient navigators receiving grants under section 340A. (7) Assisting with understanding reimbursement and health insurance coverage options, including completing eligibility and enrollment forms. (8) Assisting with understanding where abortion services are legal and the ways in which abortion services may be restricted. (d) Patient navigator protections (1) In general No individual, entity, or State may prevent, restrict, impede, or disadvantage an entity eligible to receive a grant under this section by nature of delivering services described in subsection (c), or any affiliate of such an entity or individual or other entity collaborating with such an entity, from— (A) providing or assisting a health care provider, or any other person, with eligible services described in subsection (c) related to reproductive health care services— (i) lawful in the State in which services are to be provided; or (ii) provided for an individual who does not reside in the State in which the services are to be provided; or (B) carrying out the activities described in this section in any State, including any State in which abortion services are not lawful. (2) Enforcement (A) Attorney General The Attorney General may commence a civil action on behalf of the United States against any State, or against any government official, individual, or entity that enacts, implements, or enforces a limitation or requirement that violates paragraph (1). The court shall hold unlawful and set aside the limitation or requirement if it is in violation of paragraph (1). (B) Private right of action Any reproductive health patient navigator adversely affected by an alleged violation of paragraph (1) may commence a civil action against any State that violates this subsection, against any government official that enacts, implements, or enforces a limitation or requirement that violates paragraph (1), or against any individual who, pursuant to State law, prevents, restricts, impedes, or disadvantages the entity from carrying out activities in violation of paragraph (1). The court shall hold unlawful and enjoin the limitation or requirement if it is in violation of paragraph (1). (C) Equitable relief In any action under this subsection, the court may award appropriate equitable relief, including temporary, preliminary, or permanent injunctive relief. (D) Costs In any action under this subsection, the court shall award costs of litigation, as well as reasonable attorney’s fees, to any prevailing plaintiff.

I 118th CONGRESS 1st Session H. R. 4268 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES June 21, 2023 Ms. Strickland (for herself, Mrs. Fletcher , Ms. Bush , Mr. Smith of Washington , Mr. Pocan , Mr. Cleaver , Ms. Titus , Mr. Connolly , Ms. Chu , Ms. Crockett , Mr. Panetta , Ms. Kamlager-Dove , Ms. Sánchez , Mr. Casten , Mrs. McClellan , Ms. DelBene , and Mrs. Ramirez ) introduced the following bill; which was referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce A BILL To authorize grants to eligible entities to pay for travel-related expenses and logistical support for individuals with respect to accessing abortion services, and for other purposes. 1. Short title This Act may be cited as the Reproductive Health Travel Fund Act of 2023 . 2. Findings Congress finds as follows: (1) On June 24, 2022, in its decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization (142 S. Ct. 2228 (2022)) (referred to in this section as the Dobbs decision ), the Supreme Court overruled Roe v. Wade (410 U.S. 113 (1973)), eliminating the constitutional right to abortion and reversing decades of precedent recognizing the constitutional right to terminate a pregnancy. (2) While abortion has never been available to all even under Roe v. Wade, the Dobbs decision has decimated access for millions of people in the United States. More than half of States have already banned abortion or are likely to do so. In fact, just 100 days after the Dobbs decision was announced, 66 clinics across 15 States had already been forced to stop offering abortion services. (3) As expected, the implications of the Dobbs decision will fall hardest on people who already face barriers to health care access due to systemic barriers and discrimination, particularly Black people, Indigenous people, and other people of color, people with disabilities, people in rural areas, young people, people with documentation barriers, LGBTQ+ people, people who are parenting, people with complex medical needs who require hospital-based care, and people having difficulty making ends meet. (4) Abortion bans prevent many people from accessing care they want and need. An estimated 10,670 fewer people accessed abortions at clinics in the first 2 months immediately following the Dobbs decision. (5) People have always had abortions and always will, even in the face of legal, financial, and logistical barriers, or criminalization. While some will self-manage their abortions, and have the option of using pills that are medically safe and effective, many others are traveling hundreds of miles out of State, or are forced to carry pregnancies to term. (6) Just months after the Dobbs decision, one-third of women of reproductive age in the United States faced excessive travel times for abortion. For residents of States that had banned abortion, travel times increased by more than 4 hours on average. Black women faced the greatest impact, with 40 percent needing to drive at least 1 hour for abortion care after the decision, versus 15 percent before the decision. (7) Longer travel times lead to a host of other burdens for abortion patients, including the cost of transportation, food, lodging, childcare, and lost wages. (8) Abortion funds and practical support funds (referred to in this section as funds ) are community-based organizations that support people in overcoming financial and logistical barriers to abortion care. (9) Funds work together to remove financial and logistical barriers to abortion access and have been doing this work for decades. Some of these barriers are transportation, food, lodging, childcare, translation, doula services, among other barriers. (10) Many funds are led by people who have had abortions themselves, including a growing base of Black and Brown leaders who have themselves faced abortion obstacles and understand the complex circumstances individuals may face. (11) Abortion funds have a history of being under-resourced and rely mostly on volunteer time and energy to support communities. (12) Abortion and practical support funds hold some of the closest ties to people who are having abortions and have the first-hand experience, up-to-date and on-the-ground knowledge, and the regional and national connections needed to support abortion seekers financially, emotionally, or logistically. (13) More and more States are seeking to ban abortion or enact extreme restrictions, significantly limiting the circumstances in which abortions are available. Furthermore, people have been prevented from seeking care because of the confusion created by abortion restrictions, which has contributed to a chilling effect for people seeking legal care out of State. People seeking abortions often do not have a full understanding of the abortion laws in their State and people calling abortion funds for support often ask if they are doing something illegal by traveling to get care. Abortion funds serve to mitigate this confusion and directly connect people to accurate information. (14) Clinics in States where abortion is legal and more accessible continue to receive an influx of people seeking abortions. Provider shortages, together with this rapid increase in patients, is causing longer waits for appointments, particularly for clinics near States with bans, many of which have had waiting times of more than 3 weeks. (15) When people are not able to access an abortion when they need it, they are often forced to seek an abortion much further into their pregnancy. This increases costs exponentially. Barriers to abortion care after the Dobbs decision have led to an increasing complexity in the cases that abortion funds are managing. People who are forced to cross State lines for abortion care may need support for coordinating and paying for higher logistical barriers (such as transportation, lodging, meals, childcare, medication) to access the abortion care they want, need, and deserve. For many, the increased financial burden will push abortion care completely out of reach without financial and logistical assistance for appointment costs and travel. (16) Funds often collaborate to fully meet the needs of people who are facing barriers to their abortion care, including by filling any remaining funding gaps or referring a caller traveling across regions to another fund. A national network of almost 100 abortion and practical support funds has demonstrated these funds are uniquely positioned to lead at this moment and need support. 3.

Short title This Act may be cited as the Health Equity and Access under the Law for Immigrant Families Act of 2023 or the HEAL for Immigrant Families Act of 2023 . 2. Findings; purpose (a) Findings Congress finds as follows: (1) Health insurance coverage reduces harmful racial, economic, gender, and health inequities by alleviating cost barriers to, and increasing utilization of, necessary health care services, especially among low-income and underserved populations. (2) Based solely on their immigration status, many immigrants and their families face legal and policy restrictions on their ability to obtain affordable health insurance coverage through Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and the health insurance exchanges. (3) Lack of health insurance coverage contributes to persistent inequities in the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of health conditions. This leads to negative health outcomes for immigrants and their families, especially Black, Indigenous, Latinx, Asian, Pacific Islander, and other Immigrants of Color. (4) Black immigrant women often cite cost as a major barrier to health care. Many who are undocumented forgo doctor visits altogether due to the financial burden in addition to consistent racial bias by medical practitioners and racism in health care. (5) Nearly half of immigrant women are of reproductive age. Immigrant women, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) immigrants, and immigrants with disabilities disproportionately live in households with low incomes and lack health insurance coverage. Legal and policy barriers to affordable health insurance coverage significantly exacerbate their risk of negative pregnancy-related and other reproductive and sexual health outcomes, with lasting health and economic consequences for immigrant women, LGBTQ immigrants, immigrants with disabilities, and their families and society as a whole. (6) Denying health insurance coverage or imposing waiting periods for health insurance coverage on the basis of immigration status unfairly hinders immigrants’ ability to reach and maintain their optimal levels of health and undermines the economic well-being of their families. (7) Like the Hyde amendment’s prohibition on public insurance coverage for abortion care, immigration-related health care eligibility barriers have long curtailed access to abortion. In June 2022, in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, the Supreme Court of the United States overturned the constitutional right to abortion, exacerbating pre-existing barriers. In the year since the Dobbs decision was issued, 19 States have banned or restricted abortion—disproportionately impacting 15 million women of color and millions of transgender and nonbinary people. Notably, in 2022, 39 percent of all Latinas living in States that were likely to ban abortion following the Dobbs decision were born outside of the United States—this group includes people with varying citizenship statuses, among whom fear of surveillance may be particularly prevalent, due to disproportionate investigation and surveillance that many immigrant communities already face. Bans and restrictions on abortion exacerbate the fear of criminalization in immigrant communities, and contribute to a chilling effect that leads many immigrants to forego reproductive health care and coverage of any kind as they navigate these intersecting risks of criminalization. Polling conducted in 2018 found one in four Latina/o voters (24 percent) had a close family member or friend delay or avoid health care because of fear related to discriminatory immigration policies, and one in five (19 percent) said the same about reproductive health care. (8) Ensuring access to crucial coverage of reproductive and sexual health services such as contraception and pregnancy-related care through Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act is imperative, with only half (52 percent) of immigrants at risk of unintended pregnancy receiving contraceptive care in the previous year. Many immigrants are being denied the basic human right to make the health care decisions they believe are best for them and their families, including abortion care, simply because of their immigration status. In States along the Southern Border, immigrant communities are subject to interior checkpoints that increase the threat of family separation, deportation, and detention, and compound the harm of abortion restrictions that force people to travel to obtain care. Immigrants living without documentation, in particular, may have no way of obtaining an abortion when immigration enforcement and abortion restrictions combine to prevent them from traveling to a provider. Further, due to the high cost of travel associated with the onslaught of abortion bans, practical support organizations that assist with procedure and travel costs have been experiencing high demand, and struggle with inadequate resources. Accessing support services can be out of reach for those without reliable technology to research and maintain contact with support services, or who encounter linguistic barriers when support services are not able to provide translators. For many, abortion care will be entirely inaccessible due to these compounding barriers, thus exacerbating the need for accessible reproductive and sexual health services such as contraception and pregnancy-related and post-pregnancy care. (9) International human rights standards hold that governments have an affirmative obligation to ensure that everyone, including immigrants, can access safe, respectful, culturally and linguistically appropriate, and high-quality pregnancy-related care, including postpartum care, free from discrimination or violence. Medicaid is the Nation’s single largest payer for pregnancy-related care. Nevertheless, barriers to health coverage persist for pregnant and postpartum people, particularly immigrants. (10) Immigrants—especially Black, Indigenous, Latinx, Asian, and Pacific Islander immigrants—are among those most harmed by the United States pregnancy-related morbidity and mortality epidemic, which is the worst among high-income nations. Black people are nearly four times more likely than White people to suffer pregnancy-related death, and twice as likely to suffer maternal morbidity. Indigenous people are two and a half times more likely than White people to die from a pregnancy-related death. The majority of United States pregnancy-related deaths are preventable. Lack of access to health care, immigration status, poverty, and exposure to racism, sexism, and xenophobia in and beyond the health care system contribute to the disproportionately high number of pregnancy-related deaths among BIPOC birthing and postpartum people. Unnecessary barriers that limit pregnant and postpartum immigrants’ access to health care undermine their health, safety, and human rights. (11) One in seven United States residents is foreign-born, approximately one in four children in the United States has at least one immigrant parent, and the population of immigrant families in the United States is expected to continue to grow in the coming years. It is therefore in our collective public health and economic interest to remove legal and policy barriers to affordable health insurance coverage that are based on immigration status. (12) Delaying or denying health insurance coverage because of immigration status can impede mental health and substance use prevention and early intervention interventions. Not acknowledging the impacts of trauma can impact mental health and substance use, and conditions may increase in severity without appropriate and consistent support and treatment. (13) Although individuals granted relief under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program are authorized to live and work in the United States, they have been unfairly excluded from the definitions of lawfully present and lawfully residing for purposes of health insurance coverage provided through the Department of Health and Human Services, including Medicaid, CHIP, and the health insurance exchanges. (14) On April 26, 2023, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) published a proposed rule that would modify the definition of lawfully present used to determine eligibility for Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) health plans and certain other health care programs. Codifying these protections in legislation is crucial to ensure individuals granted relief under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program and those who gain new forms of administrative relief are not similarly excluded in future administrative action. This is even more imperative as more than a quarter of DACA recipients are currently uninsured as they await the finalization of the proposed rule. (15) Since immigration law evolves constantly, new immigration categories for individuals with federally authorized presence in the United States may be created. (16) Some States continue to unwisely restrict Medicaid access for immigrants who have long resided in the United States, fueling significant health inequities and increasing health care costs for individuals and the public. (17) Congress restored Medicaid eligibility for individuals living in the United States under the Compacts of Free Association as part of bipartisan legislation in December 2020 and should build on that success by ensuring all immigrants can access care. (b) Purpose It is the purpose of this Act to— (1) ensure that all individuals who are lawfully present in the United States are eligible for all federally funded health care programs; (2) advance the ability of undocumented individuals to obtain health insurance coverage through the health insurance exchanges established under part II of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Public Law 111–148 ; (3) eliminate the authority for States to restrict Medicaid eligibility for lawful permanent residents; and (4) eliminate other barriers to accessing Medicaid, CHIP, and other medical assistance. 3.

I 118th CONGRESS 1st Session H. R. 4901 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES July 26, 2023 Ms. Bush (for herself, Ms. Pressley , Mr. Connolly , Mr. Bowman , Mr. McGovern , Mrs. Ramirez , Ms. Velázquez , Ms. Barragán , Ms. Crockett , Ms. Tlaib , Ms. Norton , Ms. McClellan , Mr. Pocan , Ms. Jayapal , Ms. Meng , Ms. Moore of Wisconsin , Ms. Salinas , Mr. Morelle , Ms. Tokuda , Ms. Escobar , Mr. Castro of Texas , Ms. Wilson of Florida , Mr. Tonko , and Mr. Nadler ) introduced the following bill; which was referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce A BILL To amend the Public Health Service Act to improve reproductive health care of individuals with disabilities. 1. Short title This Act may be cited as the Reproductive Health Care Accessibility Act . 2. Findings Congress finds the following: (1) In the United States, approximately 1 in 4 adults have some type of disability, more than 1 in 10 individuals with disabilities can become pregnant, and over 4,100,000 people are parents with disabilities. (2) All people, including individuals with disabilities, have the right to decide if, when, and how to start and raise a family as well as have healthy pregnancies and postpartum periods. (3) Title II and III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 ( 42 U.S.C. 12131 et seq. and 12181 et seq.), section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 ( 29 U.S.C. 794 ), and section 1557 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ( 42 U.S.C. 18116 ) provide individuals with disabilities with the right to equitably access and receive health care. (4) Disabled people face unique barriers when accessing reproductive health care, including accessibility issues at health care facilities, lack of accessible medical diagnostic equipment, barriers to accessible travel, delay in receiving preventative services, and lack of health care providers with training and knowledge on the needs of individuals with disabilities receiving reproductive health care. (5) Reproductive health care is critical to a person’s long-term health. Disabled people have higher mortality rates from reproductive related cancers often due to lack of access to reproductive health care. (6) The United States Access Board has established standards for accessible medical diagnostic equipment; however without enforceable standards adopted by the Department of Health and Human Services and Department of Justice, systemic improvements in the availability of accessible medical diagnostic equipment will not be achieved. (7) Disabled people have an equal right to reproductive autonomy, but harmful stereotypes about people with disabilities create barriers to getting care that respects that autonomy. (8) Laws that restrict access to reproductive health care, including abortion care, disproportionally harm people who already face barriers to reproductive health care, which includes disabled people. (9) Individuals with and without disabilities want children at the same frequency, but individuals with disabilities are less likely to receive contraception counseling and timely prenatal care, experience a higher rate of sterilization, and are at a greater risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes. (10) Diversity and inclusion in the health care workforce is a critical factor in the delivery of high-quality, culturally competent health care and improves patient outcomes. However, the rate of students and trainees with disabilities in medical and allied health education remains low compared to those without disabilities. 3. Program for training the workforce Part D of title VII of the Public Health Service Act ( 42 U.S.C. 294 et seq. ) is amended by adding at the end the following: 760A.

Short title This Act may be cited as the Right to Contraception Act . 2. Definitions In this Act: (1) Contraception The term contraception means an action taken to prevent pregnancy, including the use of contraceptives or fertility-awareness-based methods and sterilization procedures. (2) Contraceptive The term contraceptive means any drug, device, or biological product intended for use in the prevention of pregnancy, whether specifically intended to prevent pregnancy or for other health needs, that is approved, cleared, authorized, or licensed under section 505, 510(k), 513(f)(2), 515, or 564 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act ( 21 U.S.C. 355 , 360(k), 360c(f)(2), 360e, 360bbb–3) or section 351 of the Public Health Service Act ( 42 U.S.C. 262 ). (3) Government The term government includes each branch, department, agency, instrumentality, and official of the United States or a State. (4) Health care provider The term health care provider means any entity or individual (including any physician, certified nurse-midwife, nurse, nurse practitioner, physician assistant, and pharmacist) that is licensed or otherwise authorized by a State to provide health care services. (5) State The term State includes each of the 50 States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and each territory and possession of the United States, and any political subdivision of any of the foregoing, including any unit of local government, such as a county, city, town, village, or other general purpose political subdivision of a State. 3. Findings Congress finds the following: (1) The right to contraception is a fundamental right, central to an individual’s privacy, health, well-being, dignity, liberty, equality, and ability to participate in the social and economic life of the Nation. (2) The Supreme Court has repeatedly recognized the constitutional right to contraception. (3) In Griswold v. Connecticut (381 U.S. 479 (1965)), the Supreme Court first recognized the constitutional right for married people to use contraceptives. (4) In Eisenstadt v. Baird (405 U.S. 438 (1972)), the Supreme Court confirmed the constitutional right of all people to legally access contraceptives regardless of marital status. (5) In Carey v. Population Services International (431 U.S. 678 (1977)), the Supreme Court affirmed the constitutional right to contraceptives for minors. (6) The right to contraception has been repeatedly recognized internationally as a human right. The United Nations Population Fund has published several reports outlining family planning as a basic human right that advances women’s health, economic empowerment, and equality. (7) Access to contraceptives is internationally recognized by the World Health Organization as advancing other human rights such as the right to life, liberty, expression, health, work, and education. (8) Contraception is safe, essential health care, and access to contraceptive products and services is central to people’s ability to participate equally in economic and social life in the United States and globally. Contraception allows people to make decisions about their families and their lives. (9) Contraception is key to sexual and reproductive health. Contraception is critical to preventing unintended pregnancy, and many contraceptives are highly effective in preventing and treating a wide array of medical conditions and decrease the risk of certain cancers. (10) Contraception has been associated with improved health outcomes for women, their families, and their communities and reduces rates of maternal and infant mortality and morbidity. (11) The United States has a long history of reproductive coercion, including the childbearing forced upon enslaved women, as well as the forced sterilization of Black women, Puerto Rican women, indigenous women, immigrant women, and disabled women, and reproductive coercion continues to occur. This history also includes the coercive testing of contraceptive pills on women and girls in Puerto Rico. (12) The right to make personal decisions about contraceptive use is important for all Americans, and is especially critical for historically marginalized groups, including Black, indigenous, and other people of color; immigrants; LGBTQ+ people; people with disabilities; people paid low wages; and people living in rural and underserved areas. (13) Many people who are part of the marginalized groups described in paragraph (12) already face barriers, exacerbated by social, political, economic, and environmental inequities, to comprehensive health care, including reproductive health care, that reduce their ability to make decisions about their health, families, and lives. (14) State and Federal policies governing pharmaceutical and insurance policies affect the accessibility of contraceptives and the settings in which contraception services are delivered. (15) People engage in interstate commerce to access contraception services. (16) To provide contraception services, health care providers employ and obtain commercial services from doctors, nurses, and other personnel who engage in interstate commerce and travel across State lines. (17) Congress has the authority to enact this Act to protect access to contraception pursuant to— (A) its powers under the Commerce Clause of section 8 of article I of the Constitution of the United States; (B) its powers under section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States to enforce the provisions of section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment; and (C) its powers under the necessary and proper clause of section 8 of article I of the Constitution of the United States. (18) Congress has used its authority in the past to protect and expand access to contraception information, products, and services. (19) In 1970, Congress established the family planning program under title X of the Public Health Service Act ( 42 U.S.C. 300 et seq. ), the only Federal grant program dedicated to family planning and related services, providing access to information, products, and services for contraception. (20) In 1972, Congress required the Medicaid program to cover family planning services and supplies and the Medicaid program currently accounts for 75 percent of Federal funds spent on family planning. (21) In 2010, Congress enacted the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ( Public Law 111–148 ) (referred to in this section as the ACA ). Among other provisions, the ACA included provisions to expand the affordability and accessibility of contraception by requiring health insurance plans to provide coverage for preventive services with no patient cost-sharing. (22) As of June 2023, at least 4 States tried to ban access to some or all contraceptives by restricting access to public funding for these products and services. Furthermore, Arkansas, Mississippi, Missouri, and Texas have infringed on people’s ability to access their contraceptive care by violating the free choice of provider requirement under the Medicaid program. (23) Providers’ refusals to offer contraceptives and information related to contraception based on their own personal beliefs impede patients from obtaining their preferred method of contraception, with laws in 12 States as of the date of introduction of this Act specifically allowing health care providers to refuse to provide services related to contraception. (24) States have attempted to define abortion expansively so as to include contraceptives in State bans on abortion and have also restricted access to emergency contraception. (25) Justice Thomas, in his concurring opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization (142 S. Ct. 2228 (2022)), stated that the Supreme Court should reconsider all of this Court’s substantive due process precedents, including Griswold, Lawrence, and Obergefell and that the Court has a duty to correct the error established in those precedents by overruling them. (26) In order to further public health and to combat efforts to restrict access to reproductive health care, congressional action is necessary to protect access to contraceptives, contraception, and information related to contraception for everyone, regardless of actual or perceived race, ethnicity, sex (including gender identity and sexual orientation), income, disability, national origin, immigration status, or geography. 4. Purposes The purposes of this Act are— (1) to provide a clear and comprehensive right to contraception; (2) to permit individuals to seek and obtain contraceptives and engage in contraception, and to permit health care providers to facilitate that care; and (3) to protect an individual’s ability to make decisions about their body, medical care, family, and life’s course, and thereby protect the individual’s ability to participate equally in the economic and social life of the United States. 5. Permitted services (a) In general An individual has a statutory right under this Act to obtain contraceptives and to voluntarily engage in contraception, free from coercion, and a health care provider has a corresponding right to provide contraceptives, contraception, and information, referrals, and services related to contraception. (b) Limitations or requirements The statutory rights specified in subsection (a) shall not be limited or otherwise infringed through any limitation or requirement that— (1) expressly, effectively, implicitly, or as-implemented singles out— (A) the provision of contraceptives, contraception, or contraception-related information; (B) health care providers who provide contraceptives, contraception, or contraception-related information; or (C) facilities in which contraceptives, contraception, or contraception-related information is provided; and (2) impedes access to contraceptives, contraception, or contraception-related information. (c) Exception To defend against a claim that a limitation or requirement violates a health care provider’s or individual’s statutory rights under subsection (b), a party must establish, by clear and convincing evidence, that— (1) the limitation or requirement significantly advances access to contraceptives, contraception, and information related to contraception; and (2) access to contraceptives, contraception, and information related to contraception or the health of patients cannot be advanced by a less restrictive alternative measure or action. (d) Rule of construction Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the authority of the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, to approve, clear, authorize, or license contraceptives under section 505, 510(k), 513(f)(2), 515, or 564 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act ( 21 U.S.C. 355 , 360(k), 360c(f)(2), 360e, 360bbb–3) or section 351 of the Public Health Service Act ( 42 U.S.C. 262 ), or for the Federal Government to enforce such approval, clearance, authorization, or licensure. 6. Applicability and preemption (a) General application (1) In general Except as provided in subsection (c), this Act supersedes and applies to the law of the Federal Government and each State, and the implementation of such law, whether statutory, common law, or otherwise, and whether adopted before or after the date of enactment of this Act. (2) Prohibition Neither the Federal Government nor any State may administer, implement, or enforce any law, rule, regulation, standard, or other provision having the force and effect of law in a manner that— (A) prohibits or restricts the sale, provision, or use of any contraceptives as defined in Sec. 2 (2); (B) prohibits or restricts any individual from aiding another individual in voluntarily obtaining or using any contraceptives or contraceptive methods; or (C) exempts any contraceptives or contraceptive methods from any other generally applicable law in a way that would make it more difficult to sell, provide, obtain, or use such contraceptives or contraceptive methods. (3) Relationship with other laws This Act applies notwithstanding any other provision of Federal law, including the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 ( 42 U.S.C. 2000bb et seq. ). (b) Subsequently enacted federal legislation Federal law enacted after the date of enactment of this Act is subject to this Act, unless such law explicitly excludes such application by reference to this Act. (c) Limitations The provisions of this Act shall not supersede or otherwise affect any provision of Federal law relating to coverage under (and shall not be construed as requiring the provision of specific benefits under) group health plans or group or individual health insurance coverage or coverage under a Federal health care program (as defined in section 1128B(f) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1320a–7b(f))), including coverage provided under section 1905(a)(4)(C) of the Social Security Act ( 42 U.S.C. 1396d(a)(4)(C) ) and section 2713 of the Public Health Service Act ( 42 U.S.C. 300gg–13 ). (d) Defense In any cause of action against an individual or entity who is subject to a limitation or requirement that violates this Act, in addition to the remedies specified in section 8, this Act shall also apply to, and may be raised as a defense by, such an individual or entity. (e) Effective date This Act shall take effect immediately upon the date of enactment of this Act. 7. Rules of construction (a) In general In interpreting the provisions of this Act, a court shall liberally construe such provisions to effectuate the purposes described in section 4. (b) Rule of construction Nothing in this Act shall be construed— (1) to authorize any government to interfere with a health care provider’s ability to provide contraceptives or information related to contraception or a patient’s ability to obtain contraceptives or to engage in contraception; or (2) to permit or sanction the conduct of any sterilization procedure without the patient’s voluntary and informed consent. (c) Other individuals considered as government officials Any individual who, by operation of a provision of Federal or State law, is permitted to implement or enforce a limitation or requirement that violates section 5 shall be considered a government official for purposes of this Act. 8. Enforcement (a) Attorney general The Attorney General may commence a civil action on behalf of the United States against any State that violates, or against any government official (including an individual described in section 7(c)) that implements or enforces a limitation or requirement that violates, section 5. The court shall hold unlawful and set aside the limitation or requirement if it is in violation of this Act. (b) Private right of action (1) In general Any individual or entity, including any health care provider or patient, adversely affected by an alleged violation of this Act, may commence a civil action against any State that violates, or against any government official (including an individual described in section 7(c)) that implements or enforces a limitation or requirement that violates, section 5. The court shall hold unlawful and set aside the limitation or requirement if it is in violation of this Act. (2) Health care provider A health care provider may commence an action for relief on its own behalf, on behalf of the provider’s staff, and on behalf of the provider’s patients who are or may be adversely affected by an alleged violation of this Act. (c) Equitable relief In any action under this section, the court may award appropriate equitable relief, including temporary, preliminary, and permanent injunctive relief. (d) Costs In any action under this section, the court shall award costs of litigation, as well as reasonable attorney’s fees, to any prevailing plaintiff. A plaintiff shall not be liable to a defendant for costs or attorney’s fees in any nonfrivolous action under this section. (e) Jurisdiction The district courts of the United States shall have jurisdiction over proceedings under this Act and shall exercise the same without regard to whether the party aggrieved shall have exhausted any administrative or other remedies that may be provided for by law. (f) Abrogation of state immunity Neither a State that enforces or maintains, nor a government official (including an individual described in section 7(c)) who is permitted to implement or enforce any limitation or requirement that violates section 5 shall be immune under the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, the Eleventh Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, or any other source of law, from an action in a Federal or State court of competent jurisdiction challenging that limitation or requirement. 9. Severability If any provision of this Act, or the application of such provision to any individual, entity, government, or circumstance, is held to be unconstitutional, the remainder of this Act, or the application of such provision to all other individuals, entities, governments, or circumstances, shall not be affected thereby. 118 HR 62 IH: Safeguard Healthcare Industry Employees from Litigation and Distress Act U.S. House of Representatives 2023-01-09 text/xml EN Pursuant to Title 17 Section 105 of the United States Code, this file is not subject to copyright protection and is in the public domain.

      "['\\xa0Well thank you for the question, but I’ll use a little bit of my time to respond to that very important issue before. The American people deserve to know, Quasem Soleimani, the Iranian general, was responsible for the death of hundreds of American servicemembers. When the opportunity came, we saw him headed to Baghdad to kill more Americans, President Trump didn’t hesitate and Quasem Soleimani is gone. But you deserve to know that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris actually criticized the decision to take out Quasem Soleimani. It’s really inexplicable, but with regard to Joe Biden it’s explainable, because history records that Joe Biden actually opposed the raid against Osama bin Laden. It’s absolutely essential that we have a commander in chief who will not hesitate to act to protect American lives and to protect American servicemembers, and that’s what you have in President Donald Trump. Now with regard to the Supreme Court of the United States. Let me say, President Trump and I could not be more enthusiastic about the opportunity to see Judge Amy Coney Barrett become Justice Amy Coney Barrett. She’s a brilliant woman, and she will bring a lifetime of experience and a sizable American family, to the Supreme Court of the United States. And our hope is, in the hearing next week, unlike Justice Kavanaugh received with treatment from you and others. We hope she gets a fair hearing. And we particularly hope that we don’t see the kind of attacks on her Christian faith that we saw before. Democratic Chairman of the Judiciary Committee before, when Judge Barrett was being confirmed for the Court of Appeals, expressed concern that the “dogma of her faith lived loudly in her.” Dick Durbin of Illinois said that it was a concern. Senator, I know one of our judicial nominees, you actually attacked because they were a member of the Catholic Knights of Columbus, just because the Knights of Columbus holds pro-life views.\\n\\xa0My hope is that when the hearing takes place, that Judge Amy Coney Barrett will be respected –\\n\\xa0– treated respectfully and voted and confirmed to the Supreme Court of United States.\\n\\xa0Well, thank you, Susan. Let me just say, addressing your very first question, I couldn’t be more proud to serve as vice president to a President who stands without apology for the sanctity of human life. I’m pro-life. I don’t apologize for it. And this is another one of those cases where there’s such a dramatic contrast. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris support taxpayer funding of abortion, all the way up to the moment of birth, late-term abortion. They want to increase funding to Planned Parenthood of America. Now for our part, I would never presume how Judge Amy Coney Barrett would rule on the Supreme Court of the United States but we’ll continue to stand strong for the right to life. When you speak about the Supreme Court, though, I think the American people really deserve an answer, Senator Harris. Are you and Joe Biden gonna pack the court if Judge Amy Coney Barrett is confirmed? I mean, there have been 29 vacancies on the Supreme Court during presidential election years, from George Washington to Barack Obama. Presidents have nominated in all 29 cases. But your party is actually openly advocating adding seats to the Supreme Court, which has had nine seats for 150 years, if you don’t get your way. This is a classic case of if you can’t win by the rules, you’re going to change the rules. Now you’ve refused to answer the question, Joe Biden has refused to answer the question. I think the American people would really like to know. If Judge Amy Coney Barrett is confirmed to the Supreme Court of the United States, are you and Joe Biden, if somehow you win this election, going to pack the Supreme Court to get your way?\\n But for me, I would tell you that for me the sanctity of life proceeds out of the belief that — that ancient principle that — where God says before you were formed in the womb, I knew you, and so for my first time in public life, I sought to stand with great compassion for the sanctity of life.\\nThe state of Indiana has also sought to make sure that we expand alternatives in health care counseling for women, non-abortion alternatives. I’m also very pleased at the fact we’re well on our way in Indiana to becoming the most pro-adoption state in America. I think if you’re going to be pro-life, you should — you should be pro-adoption.\\nBut what I can’t understand is with Hillary Clinton and now Senator Kaine at her side is to support a practice like partial-birth abortion. I mean, to hold to the view — and I know Senator Kaine, you hold pro-life views personally — but the very idea that a child that is almost born into the world could still have their life taken from them is just anathema to me.\\nAnd I cannot — I can’t conscience about — about a party that supports that. Or that — I know you’ve historically opposed taxpayer funding of abortion. But Hillary Clinton wants to — wants to repeal the longstanding provision in the law where we said we wouldn’t use taxpayer dollars to fund abortion.\\nSo for me, my faith informs my life. I try and spend a little time on my knees every day. But it all for me begins with cherishing the dignity, the worth, the value of every human life.\\n No, it’s really not. Donald Trump and I would never support legislation that punished women who made the heartbreaking choice to end a pregnancy.\\n We just never would.\\n Well, look, it’s — look, he’s not a polished politician like you and Hillary Clinton. And so…\\n You know, things don’t always come out exactly the way he means them.\\n But I’m telling you what the policy of our administration would be.\\n Yeah.\\n I’m telling you…\\n Senator, you’ve whipped out that Mexican thing again. He — look…\\n There are criminal aliens in this country, Tim, who have come into this country illegally who are perpetrating violence and taking American lives.\\n He also said and many of them are good people. You keep leaving that out of your quote. And if you want me to go there, I’ll go there.\\nBut here’s — there is a choice, and it is a choice on life. I couldn’t be more proud to be standing with Donald Trump, who’s standing for the right to life. It’s a principle that — Senator Kaine — and I’m very gentle about this, because I really do respect you — it’s a principle that you embrace.\\nAnd I have appreciated the fact that you’ve supported the Hyde amendment, which bans the use of taxpayer funding for abortion, in the past, but that’s not Hillary Clinton’s view. People need to understand, we can come together as a nation. We can create a culture of life. More and more young people today are embracing life because we know we are — we’re better for it. We can — like Mother Teresa said at that famous national prayer breakfast…', '\\xa0Thank you, Susan. First of all, Joe Biden and I are both people of faith. And it’s insulting to suggest that we would knock anyone for their faith, and in fact, Joe if elected will be only the second practicing Catholic, as President of the United States. On the issue of this nomination – Joe and I are very clear, as are the majority of the American people. We are 27 days before the decision about who will be the next president of the United States. And you know before, when this conversation has come up, you know it’s been about election year or election time. We’re literally in an election. Over 4 million people have voted. People are in the process of voting right now. And so Joe has been very clear, as the American people are: Let the American people fill that seat in the White House, and then we’ll fill that seat on the United States Supreme Court. And to your point, Susan, the issues before us couldn’t be more serious. There’s the issue of choice, and I will always fight for a woman’s right to make a decision about her own body. It should be her decision and not that of Donald Trump, and the Vice President, Michael Pence. But let’s also look at what else is before the court. It’s the Affordable Care Act. Like, literally in the midst of a public health pandemic – when over 210,000 people have died and 7 million people probably have what will be in the future considered a pre-existing condition because you contracted the virus – Donald Trump is in court right now trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. And I’ve said it before and it bears repeating: This means that there will be no more protections, if they win, for people with pre-existing conditions. This means that over 20 million people will lose your coverage. It means that if you’re under the age of 26, you can’t stay on your parents coverage anymore. And here’s the thing. The contrast couldn’t be more clear. They’re trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. Joe Biden is saying let’s expand coverage, let’s give you a choice of a public option or private coverage, let’s bring down premiums, let’s lower Medicare eligibility to 60. That’s true leadership.', ' Elaine, this is a fundamental question, a fundamental question. Hillary and I are both people out of religious backgrounds, from Methodist church experience, which was really formative for her as a public servant.\\nBut we really feel like you should live fully and with enthusiasm the commands of your faith. But it is not the role of the public servant to mandate that for everybody else.\\nSo let’s talk about abortion and choice. Let’s talk about them. We support Roe v. Wade. We support the constitutional right of American women to consult their own conscience, their own supportive partner, their own minister, but then make their own decision about pregnancy. That’s something we trust American women to do that.\\nAnd we don’t think that women should be punished, as Donald Trump said they should, for making the decision to have an abortion.\\nGovernor Pence wants to repeal Roe v. Wade. He said he wants to put it on the ash heap of history. And we have some young people in the audience who weren’t even born when Roe was decided. This is pretty important. Before Roe v. Wade, states could pass criminal laws to do just that, to punish women if they made the choice to terminate a pregnancy.\\nI think you should live your moral values. But the last thing, the very last thing that government should do is have laws that would punish women who make reproductive choices. And that is the fundamental difference between a Clinton-Kaine ticket and a Trump-Pence ticket that wants to punish women who make that choice.\\n Then why did Donald Trump say that?\\n Why did he say that?\\n Well, I would admit that’s not a polished…[crosstalk]\\n Well, can I say…\\n Great line from the — great line from the gospel of Matthew. From the fullness of the heart, the mouth speaks.\\n When Donald Trump says women should be punished or Mexicans are rapists and criminals…\\n … or John McCain is not a hero, he is showing you who he is.\\n Can you defend it?\\n You want to — you want to use a big broad brush against Mexicans on that?', ' Right.\\n Well, if that would happen, because I am pro-life, and I will be appointing pro-life judges, I would think that that will go back to the individual states.\\n If they overturned it, it will go back to the states.\\n Well, if we put another two or perhaps three justices on, that’s really what’s going to be—that will happen. And that’ll happen automatically, in my opinion, because I am putting pro-life justices on the court. I will say this: It will go back to the states, and the states will then make a determination.\\n Well, I think it’s terrible. If you go with what Hillary is saying, in the ninth month, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb of the mother just prior to the birth of the baby.\\nNow, you can say that that’s OK and Hillary can say that that’s OK. But it’s not OK with me, because based on what she’s saying, and based on where she’s going, and where she’s been, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb in the ninth month on the final day. And that’s not acceptable.', ' Well, I strongly support Roe v. Wade, which guarantees a constitutional right to a woman to make the most intimate, most difficult, in many cases, decisions about her health care that one can imagine. And in this case, it’s not only about Roe v. Wade. It is about what’s happening right now in America.\\nSo many states are putting very stringent regulations on women that block them from exercising that choice to the extent that they are defunding Planned Parenthood, which, of course, provides all kinds of cancer screenings and other benefits for women in our country.\\nDonald has said he’s in favor of defunding Planned Parenthood. He even supported shutting the government down to defund Planned Parenthood. I will defend Planned Parenthood. I will defend Roe v. Wade, and I will defend women’s rights to make their own health care decisions.\\n And we have come too far to have that turned back now. And, indeed, he said women should be punished, that there should be some form of punishment for women who obtain abortions. And I could just not be more opposed to that kind of thinking.\\n Because Roe v. Wade very clearly sets out that there can be regulations on abortion so long as the life and the health of the mother are taken into account. And when I voted as a senator, I did not think that that was the case.\\nThe kinds of cases that fall at the end of pregnancy are often the most heartbreaking, painful decisions for families to make. I have met with women who toward the end of their pregnancy get the worst news one could get, that their health is in jeopardy if they continue to carry to term or that something terrible has happened or just been discovered about the pregnancy. I do not think the United States government should be stepping in and making those most personal of decisions. So you can regulate if you are doing so with the life and the health of the mother taken into account.\\n Well, that is not what happens in these cases. And using that kind of scare rhetoric is just terribly unfortunate. You should meet with some of the women that I have met with, women I have known over the course of my life. This is one of the worst possible choices that any woman and her family has to make. And I do not believe the government should be making it.\\nYou know, I’ve had the great honor of traveling across the world on behalf of our country. I’ve been to countries where governments either forced women to have abortions, like they used to do in China, or forced women to bear children, like they used to do in Romania. And I can tell you: The government has no business in the decisions that women make with their families in accordance with their faith, with medical advice. And I will stand up for that right.', ' I don’t see how a person can separate their public life from their private life or from their faith. Our faith informs us in everything we do. My faith informs me about how to take care of the vulnerable, of how to make sure that people have a chance in life.\\n Now, you want to ask basically why I’m pro-life? It’s not simply because of my Catholic faith. That’s a factor, of course. But it’s also because of reason and science.\\nYou know, I think about 10 1/2 years ago, my wife Janna and I went to Mercy Hospital in Janesville where I was born, for our seven week ultrasound for our firstborn child, and we saw that heartbeat. A little baby was in the shape of a bean. And to this day, we have nicknamed our firstborn child Liza, “Bean.” Now I believe that life begins at conception.\\nThat’s why — those are the reasons why I’m pro-life. Now I understand this is a difficult issue, and I respect people who don’t agree with me on this, but the policy of a Romney administration will be to oppose abortions with the exceptions for rape, incest and life of the mother. What troubles me more is how this administration has handled all of these issues. Look at what they’re doing through Obamacare with respect to assaulting the religious liberties of this country. They’re infringing upon our first freedom, the freedom of religion, by infringing on Catholic charities, Catholic churches, Catholic hospitals.\\nOur church should not have to sue our federal government to maintain their religious liberties. And with respect to abortion, the Democratic Party used to say they wanted it to be safe, legal and rare. Now they support it without restriction and with taxpayer funding. Taxpayer funding in Obamacare, taxpayer funding with foreign aid. The vice president himself went to China and said that he sympathized and wouldn’t second guess their one child policy of forced abortions and sterilizations. That to me is pretty extreme.\\n All I’m saying is, if you believe that life begins at conception, that, therefore, doesn’t change the definition of life. That’s a principle. The policy of a Romney administration is to oppose abortion with exceptions for rape, incest and life of the mother.\\nNow, I’ve got to take issue with the Catholic church and religious liberty.\\n … why would they keep — why would they keep suing you? It’s a distinction without a difference.\\n We don’t think that unelected judges should make this decision; that people through their elected representatives in reaching a consensus in society through the democratic process should make this determination.', ' My religion defines who I am, and I’ve been a practicing Catholic my whole life. And has particularly informed my social doctrine. The Catholic social doctrine talks about taking care of those who — who can’t take care of themselves, people who need help. With regard to — with regard to abortion, I accept my church’s position on abortion as a — what we call a (inaudible) doctrine. Life begins at conception in the church’s judgment. I accept it in my personal life.\\nBut I refuse to impose it on equally devout Christians and Muslims and Jews, and I just refuse to impose that on others, unlike my friend here, the — the congressman. I — I do not believe that we have a right to tell other people that — women they can’t control their body. It’s a decision between them and their doctor. In my view and the Supreme Court, I’m not going to interfere with that. With regard to the assault on the Catholic church, let me make it absolutely clear, no religious institution, Catholic or otherwise, including Catholic Social Services, Georgetown Hospital, Mercy Hospital, any hospital, none has to either refer contraception, none has to pay for contraception, none has to be a vehicle to get contraception in any insurance policy they provide. That is a fact.\\nThat is a fact. Now with regard to the way in which the — we differ, my friend says that he — well I guess he accepts Governor Romney’s position now, because in the past he has argued that there was — there’s rape and forcible rape. He’s argued that in the case of rape or incest, it was still — it would be a crime to engage in having an abortion. I just fundamentally disagree with my friend.\\n You have on the issue…\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n The court — the next president will get one or two Supreme Court nominees. That’s how close Roe v. Wade is. Just ask yourself, with Robert Bork being the chief adviser on the court for — for Mr. Romney, who do you think he’s likely to appoint? Do you think he’s likely to appoint someone like Scalia or someone else on the court far right that would outlaw (inaudible) — outlaw abortion? I suspect that would happen.', ' I would consider anyone in their qualifications. I do not believe that someone who has supported Roe v. Wade that would be part of those qualifications. But I certainly would not impose any litmus test.\\n Obviously, that law waived the statute of limitations, which you could have gone back 20 or 30 years. It was a trial lawyer’s dream.\\nLet me talk to you about an important aspect of this issue. We have to change the culture of America. Those of us who are proudly pro-life understand that. And it’s got to be courage and compassion that we show to a young woman who’s facing this terribly difficult decision.\\nSenator Obama, as a member of the Illinois State Senate, voted in the Judiciary Committee against a law that would provide immediate medical attention to a child born of a failed abortion. He voted against that.\\nAnd then, on the floor of the State Senate, as he did 130 times as a state senator, he voted present.\\nThen there was another bill before the Senate Judiciary Committee in the state of Illinois not that long ago, where he voted against a ban on partial-birth abortion, one of the late-term abortion, a really — one of the bad procedures, a terrible. And then, on the floor of the Illinois State Senate, he voted present.\\nI don’t know how you vote “present” on some of that. I don’t know how you align yourself with the extreme aspect of the pro- abortion movement in America. And that’s his record, and that’s a matter of his record.\\nAnd he’ll say it has something to do with Roe v. Wade, about the Illinois State Senate. It was clear-cut votes that Senator Obama voted, I think, in direct contradiction to the feelings and views of mainstream America.\\n Just again…\\n Just again, the example of the eloquence of Senator Obama. He’s health for the mother. You know, that’s been stretched by the pro-abortion movement in America to mean almost anything.\\nThat’s the extreme pro-abortion position, quote, “health.” But, look, Cindy and I are adoptive parents. We know what a treasure and joy it is to have an adopted child in our lives. We’ll do everything we can to improve adoption in this country.', ' Well, I think it’s true that we shouldn’t apply a strict litmus test and the most important thing in any judge is their capacity to provide fairness and justice to the American people.\\nAnd it is true that this is going to be, I think, one of the most consequential decisions of the next president. It is very likely that one of us will be making at least one and probably more than one appointments and Roe versus Wade probably hangs in the balance.\\nNow I would not provide a litmus test. But I am somebody who believes that Roe versus Wade was rightly decided. I think that abortion is a very difficult issue and it is a moral issue and one that I think good people on both sides can disagree on.\\nBut what ultimately I believe is that women in consultation with their families, their doctors, their religious advisers, are in the best position to make this decision. And I think that the Constitution has a right to privacy in it that shouldn’t be subject to state referendum, any more than our First Amendment rights are subject to state referendum, any more than many of the other rights that we have should be subject to popular vote.\\n So this is going to be an important issue. I will look for those judges who have an outstanding judicial record, who have the intellect, and who hopefully have a sense of what real-world folks are going through.\\nI’ll just give you one quick example. Senator McCain and I disagreed recently when the Supreme Court made it more difficult for a woman named Lilly Ledbetter to press her claim for pay discrimination.\\nFor years, she had been getting paid less than a man had been paid for doing the exact same job. And when she brought a suit, saying equal pay for equal work, the judges said, well, you know, it’s taken you too long to bring this lawsuit, even though she didn’t know about it until fairly recently.\\nWe tried to overturn it in the Senate. I supported that effort to provide better guidance to the courts; John McCain opposed it.\\nI think that it’s important for judges to understand that if a woman is out there trying to raise a family, trying to support her family, and is being treated unfairly, then the court has to stand up, if nobody else will. And that’s the kind of judge that I want.\\n Yes, let me respond to this. If it sounds incredible that I would vote to withhold lifesaving treatment from an infant, that’s because it’s not true. The — here are the facts.\\nThere was a bill that was put forward before the Illinois Senate that said you have to provide lifesaving treatment and that would have helped to undermine Roe v. Wade. The fact is that there was already a law on the books in Illinois that required providing lifesaving treatment, which is why not only myself but pro-choice Republicans and Democrats voted against it.\\nAnd the Illinois Medical Society, the organization of doctors in Illinois, voted against it. Their Hippocratic Oath would have required them to provide care, and there was already a law in the books.\\nWith respect to partial-birth abortion, I am completely supportive of a ban on late-term abortions, partial-birth or otherwise, as long as there’s an exception for the mother’s health and life, and this did not contain that exception.\\nAnd I attempted, as many have in the past, of including that so that it is constitutional. And that was rejected, and that’s why I voted present, because I’m willing to support a ban on late-term abortions as long as we have that exception.\\nThe last point I want to make on the issue of abortion. This is an issue that — look, it divides us. And in some ways, it may be difficult to — to reconcile the two views.\\nBut there surely is some common ground when both those who believe in choice and those who are opposed to abortion can come together and say, “We should try to prevent unintended pregnancies by providing appropriate education to our youth, communicating that sexuality is sacred and that they should not be engaged in cavalier activity, and providing options for adoption, and helping single mothers if they want to choose to keep the baby.”\\nThose are all things that we put in the Democratic platform for the first time this year, and I think that’s where we can find some common ground, because nobody’s pro-abortion. I think it’s always a tragic situation.\\n We should try to reduce these circumstances.', ' I would say to that person exactly what I will say to you right now.\\nFirst of all, I cannot tell you how deeply I respect the belief about life and when it begins. I’m a Catholic, raised a Catholic. I was an altar boy. Religion has been a huge part of my life. It helped lead me through a war, leads me today.\\nBut I can’t take what is an article of faith for me and legislate it for someone who doesn’t share that article of faith, whether they be agnostic, atheist, Jew, Protestant, whatever. I can’t do that.\\nBut I can counsel people. I can talk reasonably about life and about responsibility. I can talk to people, as my wife Teresa does, about making other choices, and about abstinence, and about all these other things that we ought to do as a responsible society.\\nBut as a president, I have to represent all the people in the nation. And I have to make that judgment.\\nNow, I believe that you can take that position and not be pro- abortion, but you have to afford people their constitutional rights. And that means being smart about allowing people to be fully educated, to know what their options are in life, and making certain that you don’t deny a poor person the right to be able to have whatever the constitution affords them if they can’t afford it otherwise.\\nThat’s why I think it’s important. That’s why I think it’s important for the United States, for instance, not to have this rigid ideological restriction on helping families around the world to be able to make a smart decision about family planning.\\nYou’ll help prevent AIDS.\\nYou’ll help prevent unwanted children, unwanted pregnancies.\\nYou’ll actually do a better job, I think, of passing on the moral responsibility that is expressed in your question. And I truly respect it.\\n Well, again, the president just said, categorically, my opponent is against this, my opponent is against that. You know, it’s just not that simple. No, I’m not.\\nI’m against the partial-birth abortion, but you’ve got to have an exception for the life of the mother and the health of the mother under the strictest test of bodily injury to the mother.\\nSecondly, with respect to parental notification, I’m not going to require a 16-or 17-year-old kid who’s been raped by her father and who’s pregnant to have to notify her father. So you got to have a judicial intervention. And because they didn’t have a judicial intervention where she could go somewhere and get help, I voted against it. It’s never quite as simple as the president wants you to believe.\\n I respect their views. I completely respect their views. I am a Catholic. And I grew up learning how to respect those views. But I disagree with them, as do many.\\nI believe that I can’t legislate or transfer to another American citizen my article of faith. What is an article of faith for me is not something that I can legislate on somebody who doesn’t share that article of faith.\\nI believe that choice is a woman’s choice. It’s between a woman, God and her doctor. And that’s why I support that.\\nNow, I will not allow somebody to come in and change Roe v. Wade.\\nThe president has never said whether or not he would do that. But we know from the people he’s tried to appoint to the court he wants to.\\nI will not. I will defend the right of Roe v. Wade.\\nNow, with respect to religion, you know, as I said, I grew up a Catholic. I was an altar boy. I know that throughout my life this has made a difference to me.\\nAnd as President Kennedy said when he ran for president, he said, “I’m not running to be a Catholic president. I’m running to be a president who happens to be Catholic. “\\nMy faith affects everything that I do, in truth. There’s a great passage of the Bible that says, “What does it mean, my brother, to say you have faith if there are no deeds? Faith without works is dead. “\\nAnd I think that everything you do in public life has to be guided by your faith, affected by your faith, but without transferring it in any official way to other people.\\nThat’s why I fight against poverty. That’s why I fight to clean up the environment and protect this earth.\\nThat’s why I fight for equality and justice. All of those things come out of that fundamental teaching and belief of faith.\\nBut I know this, that President Kennedy in his inaugural address told all of us that here on Earth, God’s work must truly be our own. And that’s what we have to — I think that’s the test of public service.', ' I’m trying to decipher that.\\nMy answer is, we’re not going to spend taxpayers’ money on abortion.\\nThis is an issue that divides America, but certainly reasonable people can agree on how to reduce abortions in America.\\nI signed the partial-birth — the ban on partial-birth abortion. It’s a brutal practice. It’s one way to help reduce abortions. My opponent voted against the ban.\\nI think there ought to be parental notification laws. He’s against them.\\nI signed a bill called the Unborn Victims of Violence Act.\\nIn other words, if you’re a mom and you’re pregnant and you get killed, the murderer gets tried for two cases, not just one. My opponent was against that.\\nThese are reasonable ways to help promote a culture of life in America. I think it is a worthy goal in America to have every child protected by law and welcomed in life.\\nI also think we ought to continue to have good adoption law as an alternative to abortion.\\nAnd we need to promote maternity group homes, which my administration has done.\\nCulture of life is really important for a country to have if it’s going to be a hospitable society.\\nThank you.\\n Well, it’s pretty simple when they say: Are you for a ban on partial birth abortion? Yes or no?\\n I think it’s important to promote a culture of life. I think a hospitable society is a society where every being counts and every person matters. I believe the ideal world is one in which every child is protected in law and welcomed to life. I understand there’s great differences on this issue of abortion, but I believe reasonable people can come together and put good law in place that will help reduce the number of abortions.\\nTake, for example, the ban on partial birth abortion. It’s a brutal practice. People from both political parties came together in the halls of Congress and voted overwhelmingly to ban that practice. It made a lot of sense. My opponent, in that he’s out of the mainstream, voted against that law.\\nWhat I’m saying is, is that as we promote life and promote a culture of life, surely there are ways we can work together to reduce the number of abortions: continue to promote adoption laws — it’s a great alternative to abortion — continue to fund and promote maternity group homes; I will continue to promote abstinence programs.\\nThe last debate, my opponent said his wife was involved with those programs. That’s great. I appreciate that very much. All of us ought to be involved with programs that provide a viable alternative to abortion.\\n I don’t think a president can do that. I was disappointed in the ruling because I think abortions ought to be more rare in America, and I’m worried that that pill will create more abortions and cause more people to have abortions. This is a very important topic and it’s a very sensitive topic, because a lot of good people disagree on the issue. I think what the next president ought to do is to promote a culture of life in America. Life of the elderly and life of those living all across the country. Life of the unborn. As a matter of fact, I think a noble goal for this country is that every child, born or unborn, need to be protected by law and welcomed to life. I know we need to change a lot of minds before we get there in America. What I do believe is that we can find good, common ground on issues of parental consent or parental notification. I know we need to ban partial birth abortions. This is a place where my opponent and I have strong disagreement. I believe banning partial birth abortions would be a positive step to reducing the number of abortions in America. This is an issue that will require a new attitude. We’ve been battling over abortion for a long period of time. Surely this nation can come together to promote the value of life. Surely we can fight off these laws that will encourage doctors to — to allow doctors to take the lives of our seniors. Surely we can work together to create a cultural life so some of these youngsters who feel like they can take a neighbor’s life with a gun will understand that that’s not the way America is meant to be. Surely we can find common ground to reduce the number of abortions in America. As to the drug itself, I mentioned I was disappointed. I hope the FDA took its time to make sure that American women will be safe who use this drug.', ' Well, Jim, the FDA took 12 years, and I do support that decision. They determined it was medically safe for the women who use that drug. This is indeed a very important issue. First of all on the issue of partial birth or so-called late-term abortion, I would sign a law banning that procedure, provided that doctors have the ability to save a woman’s life or to act if her health is severely at risk. That’s not the main issue. The main issue is whether or not the Roe v. Wade decision is going to be overturned. I support a woman’s right to choose. My opponent does not. It is important because the next president is going to appoint three and maybe even four justices of the Supreme Court. And Governor Bush has declared to the anti-choice groups that he will appoint justices in the mold of Scalia and Clarence Thomas, who are known for being the most vigorous opponents of a woman’s right to choose. Here is the difference. He trusts the government to order a woman to do what it thinks she ought to do. I trust women to make the decisions that affect their lives, their destinies and their bodies. And I think a woman’s right to choose ought to be protected and defended.']\n"

      "Original Prez Debate Document:  Well thank you for the question, but I’ll use a little bit of my time to respond to that very important issue before. The American people deserve to know, Quasem Soleimani, the Iranian general, was responsible for the death of hundreds of American servicemembers. When the opportunity came, we saw him headed to Baghdad to kill more Americans, President Trump didn’t hesitate and Quasem Soleimani is gone. But you deserve to know that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris actually criticized the decision to take out Quasem Soleimani. It’s really inexplicable, but with regard to Joe Biden it’s explainable, because history records that Joe Biden actually opposed the raid against Osama bin Laden. It’s absolutely essential that we have a commander in chief who will not hesitate to act to protect American lives and to protect American servicemembers, and that’s what you have in President Donald Trump. Now with regard to the Supreme Court of the United States. Let me say, President Trump and I could not be more enthusiastic about the opportunity to see Judge Amy Coney Barrett become Justice Amy Coney Barrett. She’s a brilliant woman, and she will bring a lifetime of experience and a sizable American family, to the Supreme Court of the United States. And our hope is, in the hearing next week, unlike Justice Kavanaugh received with treatment from you and others. We hope she gets a fair hearing. And we particularly hope that we don’t see the kind of attacks on her Christian faith that we saw before. Democratic Chairman of the Judiciary Committee before, when Judge Barrett was being confirmed for the Court of Appeals, expressed concern that the “dogma of her faith lived loudly in her.” Dick Durbin of Illinois said that it was a concern. Senator, I know one of our judicial nominees, you actually attacked because they were a member of the Catholic Knights of Columbus, just because the Knights of Columbus holds pro-life views.\n",
      " My hope is that when the hearing takes place, that Judge Amy Coney Barrett will be respected –\n",
      " – treated respectfully and voted and confirmed to the Supreme Court of United States.\n",
      " Well, thank you, Susan. Let me just say, addressing your very first question, I couldn’t be more proud to serve as vice president to a President who stands without apology for the sanctity of human life. I’m pro-life. I don’t apologize for it. And this is another one of those cases where there’s such a dramatic contrast. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris support taxpayer funding of abortion, all the way up to the moment of birth, late-term abortion. They want to increase funding to Planned Parenthood of America. Now for our part, I would never presume how Judge Amy Coney Barrett would rule on the Supreme Court of the United States but we’ll continue to stand strong for the right to life. When you speak about the Supreme Court, though, I think the American people really deserve an answer, Senator Harris. Are you and Joe Biden gonna pack the court if Judge Amy Coney Barrett is confirmed? I mean, there have been 29 vacancies on the Supreme Court during presidential election years, from George Washington to Barack Obama. Presidents have nominated in all 29 cases. But your party is actually openly advocating adding seats to the Supreme Court, which has had nine seats for 150 years, if you don’t get your way. This is a classic case of if you can’t win by the rules, you’re going to change the rules. Now you’ve refused to answer the question, Joe Biden has refused to answer the question. I think the American people would really like to know. If Judge Amy Coney Barrett is confirmed to the Supreme Court of the United States, are you and Joe Biden, if somehow you win this election, going to pack the Supreme Court to get your way?\n",
      " But for me, I would tell you that for me the sanctity of life proceeds out of the belief that — that ancient principle that — where God says before you were formed in the womb, I knew you, and so for my first time in public life, I sought to stand with great compassion for the sanctity of life.\n",
      "The state of Indiana has also sought to make sure that we expand alternatives in health care counseling for women, non-abortion alternatives. I’m also very pleased at the fact we’re well on our way in Indiana to becoming the most pro-adoption state in America. I think if you’re going to be pro-life, you should — you should be pro-adoption.\n",
      "But what I can’t understand is with Hillary Clinton and now Senator Kaine at her side is to support a practice like partial-birth abortion. I mean, to hold to the view — and I know Senator Kaine, you hold pro-life views personally — but the very idea that a child that is almost born into the world could still have their life taken from them is just anathema to me.\n",
      "And I cannot — I can’t conscience about — about a party that supports that. Or that — I know you’ve historically opposed taxpayer funding of abortion. But Hillary Clinton wants to — wants to repeal the longstanding provision in the law where we said we wouldn’t use taxpayer dollars to fund abortion.\n",
      "So for me, my faith informs my life. I try and spend a little time on my knees every day. But it all for me begins with cherishing the dignity, the worth, the value of every human life.\n",
      " No, it’s really not. Donald Trump and I would never support legislation that punished women who made the heartbreaking choice to end a pregnancy.\n",
      " We just never would.\n",
      " Well, look, it’s — look, he’s not a polished politician like you and Hillary Clinton. And so…\n",
      " You know, things don’t always come out exactly the way he means them.\n",
      " But I’m telling you what the policy of our administration would be.\n",
      " Yeah.\n",
      " I’m telling you…\n",
      " Senator, you’ve whipped out that Mexican thing again. He — look…\n",
      " There are criminal aliens in this country, Tim, who have come into this country illegally who are perpetrating violence and taking American lives.\n",
      " He also said and many of them are good people. You keep leaving that out of your quote. And if you want me to go there, I’ll go there.\n",
      "But here’s — there is a choice, and it is a choice on life. I couldn’t be more proud to be standing with Donald Trump, who’s standing for the right to life. It’s a principle that — Senator Kaine — and I’m very gentle about this, because I really do respect you — it’s a principle that you embrace.\n",
      "And I have appreciated the fact that you’ve supported the Hyde amendment, which bans the use of taxpayer funding for abortion, in the past, but that’s not Hillary Clinton’s view. People need to understand, we can come together as a nation. We can create a culture of life. More and more young people today are embracing life because we know we are — we’re better for it. We can — like Mother Teresa said at that famous national prayer breakfast…\n",

      "Selected Random Sample:  Thank you, Susan. First of all, Joe Biden and I are both people of faith. And it’s insulting to suggest that we would knock anyone for their faith, and in fact, Joe if elected will be only the second practicing Catholic, as President of the United States. On the issue of this nomination – Joe and I are very clear, as are the majority of the American people. We are 27 days before the decision about who will be the next president of the United States. And you know before, when this conversation has come up, you know it’s been about election year or election time. We’re literally in an election. Over 4 million people have voted. People are in the process of voting right now. And so Joe has been very clear, as the American people are: Let the American people fill that seat in the White House, and then we’ll fill that seat on the United States Supreme Court. And to your point, Susan, the issues before us couldn’t be more serious. There’s the issue of choice, and I will always fight for a woman’s right to make a decision about her own body. It should be her decision and not that of Donald Trump, and the Vice President, Michael Pence. But let’s also look at what else is before the court. It’s the Affordable Care Act. Like, literally in the midst of a public health pandemic – when over 210,000 people have died and 7 million people probably have what will be in the future considered a pre-existing condition because you contracted the virus – Donald Trump is in court right now trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. And I’ve said it before and it bears repeating: This means that there will be no more protections, if they win, for people with pre-existing conditions. This means that over 20 million people will lose your coverage. It means that if you’re under the age of 26, you can’t stay on your parents coverage anymore. And here’s the thing. The contrast couldn’t be more clear. They’re trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. Joe Biden is saying let’s expand coverage, let’s give you a choice of a public option or private coverage, let’s bring down premiums, let’s lower Medicare eligibility to 60. That’s true leadership. (Index: 1)\n",
      "Selected Random Sample:  Well thank you for the question, but I’ll use a little bit of my time to respond to that very important issue before. The American people deserve to know, Quasem Soleimani, the Iranian general, was responsible for the death of hundreds of American servicemembers. When the opportunity came, we saw him headed to Baghdad to kill more Americans, President Trump didn’t hesitate and Quasem Soleimani is gone. But you deserve to know that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris actually criticized the decision to take out Quasem Soleimani. It’s really inexplicable, but with regard to Joe Biden it’s explainable, because history records that Joe Biden actually opposed the raid against Osama bin Laden. It’s absolutely essential that we have a commander in chief who will not hesitate to act to protect American lives and to protect American servicemembers, and that’s what you have in President Donald Trump. Now with regard to the Supreme Court of the United States. Let me say, President Trump and I could not be more enthusiastic about the opportunity to see Judge Amy Coney Barrett become Justice Amy Coney Barrett. She’s a brilliant woman, and she will bring a lifetime of experience and a sizable American family, to the Supreme Court of the United States. And our hope is, in the hearing next week, unlike Justice Kavanaugh received with treatment from you and others. We hope she gets a fair hearing. And we particularly hope that we don’t see the kind of attacks on her Christian faith that we saw before. Democratic Chairman of the Judiciary Committee before, when Judge Barrett was being confirmed for the Court of Appeals, expressed concern that the “dogma of her faith lived loudly in her.” Dick Durbin of Illinois said that it was a concern. Senator, I know one of our judicial nominees, you actually attacked because they were a member of the Catholic Knights of Columbus, just because the Knights of Columbus holds pro-life views.\n",
      " My hope is that when the hearing takes place, that Judge Amy Coney Barrett will be respected –\n",
      " – treated respectfully and voted and confirmed to the Supreme Court of United States.\n",
      " Well, thank you, Susan. Let me just say, addressing your very first question, I couldn’t be more proud to serve as vice president to a President who stands without apology for the sanctity of human life. I’m pro-life. I don’t apologize for it. And this is another one of those cases where there’s such a dramatic contrast. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris support taxpayer funding of abortion, all the way up to the moment of birth, late-term abortion. They want to increase funding to Planned Parenthood of America. Now for our part, I would never presume how Judge Amy Coney Barrett would rule on the Supreme Court of the United States but we’ll continue to stand strong for the right to life. When you speak about the Supreme Court, though, I think the American people really deserve an answer, Senator Harris. Are you and Joe Biden gonna pack the court if Judge Amy Coney Barrett is confirmed? I mean, there have been 29 vacancies on the Supreme Court during presidential election years, from George Washington to Barack Obama. Presidents have nominated in all 29 cases. But your party is actually openly advocating adding seats to the Supreme Court, which has had nine seats for 150 years, if you don’t get your way. This is a classic case of if you can’t win by the rules, you’re going to change the rules. Now you’ve refused to answer the question, Joe Biden has refused to answer the question. I think the American people would really like to know. If Judge Amy Coney Barrett is confirmed to the Supreme Court of the United States, are you and Joe Biden, if somehow you win this election, going to pack the Supreme Court to get your way?\n",
      " But for me, I would tell you that for me the sanctity of life proceeds out of the belief that — that ancient principle that — where God says before you were formed in the womb, I knew you, and so for my first time in public life, I sought to stand with great compassion for the sanctity of life.\n",
      "The state of Indiana has also sought to make sure that we expand alternatives in health care counseling for women, non-abortion alternatives. I’m also very pleased at the fact we’re well on our way in Indiana to becoming the most pro-adoption state in America. I think if you’re going to be pro-life, you should — you should be pro-adoption.\n",
      "But what I can’t understand is with Hillary Clinton and now Senator Kaine at her side is to support a practice like partial-birth abortion. I mean, to hold to the view — and I know Senator Kaine, you hold pro-life views personally — but the very idea that a child that is almost born into the world could still have their life taken from them is just anathema to me.\n",
      "And I cannot — I can’t conscience about — about a party that supports that. Or that — I know you’ve historically opposed taxpayer funding of abortion. But Hillary Clinton wants to — wants to repeal the longstanding provision in the law where we said we wouldn’t use taxpayer dollars to fund abortion.\n",
      "So for me, my faith informs my life. I try and spend a little time on my knees every day. But it all for me begins with cherishing the dignity, the worth, the value of every human life.\n",
      " No, it’s really not. Donald Trump and I would never support legislation that punished women who made the heartbreaking choice to end a pregnancy.\n",
      " We just never would.\n",

      " He also said and many of them are good people. You keep leaving that out of your quote. And if you want me to go there, I’ll go there.\n",
      "But here’s — there is a choice, and it is a choice on life. I couldn’t be more proud to be standing with Donald Trump, who’s standing for the right to life. It’s a principle that — Senator Kaine — and I’m very gentle about this, because I really do respect you — it’s a principle that you embrace.\n",
      "And I have appreciated the fact that you’ve supported the Hyde amendment, which bans the use of taxpayer funding for abortion, in the past, but that’s not Hillary Clinton’s view. People need to understand, we can come together as a nation. We can create a culture of life. More and more young people today are embracing life because we know we are — we’re better for it. We can — like Mother Teresa said at that famous national prayer breakfast… (Index: 0)\n",
      "Selected Random Sample:  My religion defines who I am, and I’ve been a practicing Catholic my whole life. And has particularly informed my social doctrine. The Catholic social doctrine talks about taking care of those who — who can’t take care of themselves, people who need help. With regard to — with regard to abortion, I accept my church’s position on abortion as a — what we call a (inaudible) doctrine. Life begins at conception in the church’s judgment. I accept it in my personal life.\n",
      "But I refuse to impose it on equally devout Christians and Muslims and Jews, and I just refuse to impose that on others, unlike my friend here, the — the congressman. I — I do not believe that we have a right to tell other people that — women they can’t control their body. It’s a decision between them and their doctor. In my view and the Supreme Court, I’m not going to interfere with that. With regard to the assault on the Catholic church, let me make it absolutely clear, no religious institution, Catholic or otherwise, including Catholic Social Services, Georgetown Hospital, Mercy Hospital, any hospital, none has to either refer contraception, none has to pay for contraception, none has to be a vehicle to get contraception in any insurance policy they provide. That is a fact.\n",
      "That is a fact. Now with regard to the way in which the — we differ, my friend says that he — well I guess he accepts Governor Romney’s position now, because in the past he has argued that there was — there’s rape and forcible rape. He’s argued that in the case of rape or incest, it was still — it would be a crime to engage in having an abortion. I just fundamentally disagree with my friend.\n",
      " You have on the issue…\n",
      "(CROSSTALK)\n",
      " The court — the next president will get one or two Supreme Court nominees. That’s how close Roe v. Wade is. Just ask yourself, with Robert Bork being the chief adviser on the court for — for Mr. Romney, who do you think he’s likely to appoint? Do you think he’s likely to appoint someone like Scalia or someone else on the court far right that would outlaw (inaudible) — outlaw abortion? I suspect that would happen. (Index: 6)\n",

      "My answer is, we’re not going to spend taxpayers’ money on abortion.\n",
      "This is an issue that divides America, but certainly reasonable people can agree on how to reduce abortions in America.\n",
      "I signed the partial-birth — the ban on partial-birth abortion. It’s a brutal practice. It’s one way to help reduce abortions. My opponent voted against the ban.\n",
      "I think there ought to be parental notification laws. He’s against them.\n",
      "I signed a bill called the Unborn Victims of Violence Act.\n",
      "In other words, if you’re a mom and you’re pregnant and you get killed, the murderer gets tried for two cases, not just one. My opponent was against that.\n",
      "These are reasonable ways to help promote a culture of life in America. I think it is a worthy goal in America to have every child protected by law and welcomed in life.\n",
      "I also think we ought to continue to have good adoption law as an alternative to abortion.\n",
      "And we need to promote maternity group homes, which my administration has done.\n",
      "Culture of life is really important for a country to have if it’s going to be a hospitable society.\n",
      "Thank you.\n",
      " Well, it’s pretty simple when they say: Are you for a ban on partial birth abortion? Yes or no?\n",
      " I think it’s important to promote a culture of life. I think a hospitable society is a society where every being counts and every person matters. I believe the ideal world is one in which every child is protected in law and welcomed to life. I understand there’s great differences on this issue of abortion, but I believe reasonable people can come together and put good law in place that will help reduce the number of abortions.\n",
      "Take, for example, the ban on partial birth abortion. It’s a brutal practice. People from both political parties came together in the halls of Congress and voted overwhelmingly to ban that practice. It made a lot of sense. My opponent, in that he’s out of the mainstream, voted against that law.\n",
      "What I’m saying is, is that as we promote life and promote a culture of life, surely there are ways we can work together to reduce the number of abortions: continue to promote adoption laws — it’s a great alternative to abortion — continue to fund and promote maternity group homes; I will continue to promote abstinence programs.\n",
      "The last debate, my opponent said his wife was involved with those programs. That’s great. I appreciate that very much. All of us ought to be involved with programs that provide a viable alternative to abortion.\n",
      " I don’t think a president can do that. I was disappointed in the ruling because I think abortions ought to be more rare in America, and I’m worried that that pill will create more abortions and cause more people to have abortions. This is a very important topic and it’s a very sensitive topic, because a lot of good people disagree on the issue. I think what the next president ought to do is to promote a culture of life in America. Life of the elderly and life of those living all across the country. Life of the unborn. As a matter of fact, I think a noble goal for this country is that every child, born or unborn, need to be protected by law and welcomed to life. I know we need to change a lot of minds before we get there in America. What I do believe is that we can find good, common ground on issues of parental consent or parental notification. I know we need to ban partial birth abortions. This is a place where my opponent and I have strong disagreement. I believe banning partial birth abortions would be a positive step to reducing the number of abortions in America. This is an issue that will require a new attitude. We’ve been battling over abortion for a long period of time. Surely this nation can come together to promote the value of life. Surely we can fight off these laws that will encourage doctors to — to allow doctors to take the lives of our seniors. Surely we can work together to create a cultural life so some of these youngsters who feel like they can take a neighbor’s life with a gun will understand that that’s not the way America is meant to be. Surely we can find common ground to reduce the number of abortions in America. As to the drug itself, I mentioned I was disappointed. I hope the FDA took its time to make sure that American women will be safe who use this drug. (Index: 10)\n",

      " Well, if we put another two or perhaps three justices on, that’s really what’s going to be—that will happen. And that’ll happen automatically, in my opinion, because I am putting pro-life justices on the court. I will say this: It will go back to the states, and the states will then make a determination.\n",
      " Well, I think it’s terrible. If you go with what Hillary is saying, in the ninth month, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb of the mother just prior to the birth of the baby.\n",

But it’s not OK with me, because based on what she’s saying, and based on where she’s going, and where she’s been, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb in the ninth month on the final day. And that’s not acceptable. (Index: 3)\n",

      "Let me talk to you about an important aspect of this issue. We have to change the culture of America. Those of us who are proudly pro-life understand that. And it’s got to be courage and compassion that we show to a young woman who’s facing this terribly difficult decision.\n",
      "Senator Obama, as a member of the Illinois State Senate, voted in the Judiciary Committee against a law that would provide immediate medical attention to a child born of a failed abortion. He voted against that.\n",
      "And then, on the floor of the State Senate, as he did 130 times as a state senator, he voted present.\n",
      "Then there was another bill before the Senate Judiciary Committee in the state of Illinois not that long ago, where he voted against a ban on partial-birth abortion, one of the late-term abortion, a really — one of the bad procedures, a terrible. And then, on the floor of the Illinois State Senate, he voted present.\n",
      "I don’t know how you vote “present” on some of that. I don’t know how you align yourself with the extreme aspect of the pro- abortion movement in America. And that’s his record, and that’s a matter of his record.\n",
      "And he’ll say it has something to do with Roe v. Wade, about the Illinois State Senate. It was clear-cut votes that Senator Obama voted, I think, in direct contradiction to the feelings and views of mainstream America.\n",
      " Just again…\n",
      " Just again, the example of the eloquence of Senator Obama. He’s health for the mother. You know, that’s been stretched by the pro-abortion movement in America to mean almost anything.\n",
      "That’s the extreme pro-abortion position, quote, “health.” But, look, Cindy and I are adoptive parents. We know what a treasure and joy it is to have an adopted child in our lives. We’ll do everything we can to improve adoption in this country. (Index: 7)\n"

      "Original Prez Debate Document: CNN  — Abortion today, at least in the United States, is a political, legal and moral powder keg. But for long stretches of history, terminating an unwanted pregnancy, especially in the early stages, was a relatively uncontroversial fact of life, historians say. Egyptian papyrus, Greek plays, Roman coins, the medieval biographies of saints, medical and midwifery manuals, and Victorian newspaper and pamphlets reveal that abortion was more common in premodern times than people might think. This long view of abortion matters, according to Mary Fissell, a professor of the history of medicine at Johns Hopkins University. That’s because assumptions about how abortion was viewed in the past color present-day arguments about abortion rights. Those rights have been severely restricted in many US states since Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court ruling that effectively made abortion legally available, was overturned on June 24, 2022, by the US Supreme Court in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization. Abortion opponents portray the rights granted by Roe v. Wade and legal access to abortion as an historical aberration, according to Fissell, which is not accurate, historians say. “We have to understand that this is much more changeable than we’ve been led to believe. There’s a steady constant of women terminating pregnancies throughout history, but the meanings of that act have changed very significantly over time and will continue to change,” said Fissell, who is working on “Long Before Roe,” a book on the history of abortion that will publish in 2025. “The Dobbs decision was not inevitable, but rather a part of a much longer cycle of restriction versus acceptance,” she said. Earliest references to abortion The first written references to abortion are contained in an ancient Egyptian papyrus written about 3,500 years ago. The Ebers Papyrus, a medical text, suggested around 1550 BC that abortion could be induced using a “plant-fibre tampon coated with a compound that included honey and crushed dates.” In ancient Greek and Rome, references to abortion and botanical substances that induce abortion were common in medical and other texts — although it’s not clear how widely they were used, Fissell said. In 411 BC, Greek playwright Aristophanes in his play Lysistrata described a desirable young woman as “trimmed and spruced with pennyroyal,” a plant thought to induce abortion. Plants and botanical substances can have toxic effects, and there’s no evidence on whether historical methods to induce abortion were effective or not. The search for silphium In ancient Rome, another plant that was thought to end an unwanted pregnancy (among other uses), was so valued it disappeared — the first recorded extinction in world history, according to archaeologist Lisa Briggs, a research fellow at Cranfield University and a visiting researcher at the British Museum. Silphium, also used to flavor food, was traded across the ancient Roman empire. The city state of Cyrene (in modern-day Libya), the only region where the plant grew, based its whole economy on the plant. It appeared on coins and other artifacts unearthed from the region, Briggs said. “Contemporary authors said it was worth its weight in gold and silver. And so it clearly had a value beyond just its tastiness. I suspect that women’s desire to use it as an abortifacient is one of the reasons the price was driven up,” said Briggs, who is searching for archaeological evidence of the plant, which was turned into a resin, in shipwrecks and museum collections. Pliny the Elder, a Roman author and philosopher who was born around 23 AD, described the plant’s ability to expel an unborn fetus along with other medical uses. It’s impossible to know for sure whether the plant would have had the desired effect, but modern-day studies on related Ferula plants and lab rats showed the plants “exhibit anti-fertility properties in rodents,” Briggs wrote in a paper she coauthored last year. Briggs believes demand for the plant among women may have been a key factor, although not the only reason, for its extinction. The plant was resistant to cultivation, Briggs noted, and climate change and a shift in soil characteristics may also have been factors. Abortionists who were saints It’s sometimes assumed that Christianity has always unequivocally condemned abortion but Maeve Callan, a professor and historian of religion at Simpson College in Iowa, said this misrepresents the past. “People act like there’s only one acceptable attitude towards abortion if you’re Catholic, or if you’re Christian more broadly, or even if you’re religious more broadly. And there’s always been a diversity of viewpoints,” said Callan, the author of the book “Sacred Sisters: Gender, Sanctity, and Power in Medieval Ireland.” Her research, along with other scholars, has uncovered four medieval Irish saints who celebrated ending pregnancy among their miracles, according to medieval manuscripts that described saints’ lives. Typically, these miracles include a nun who has breached her vow to chastity and become pregnant but, through the saint’s intervention, the pregnancy miraculously disappears. The most famous was Saint Brigid, a lesser-known patron saint of Ireland than Patrick, and one whose standing was honored with an inaugural public holiday this year. According to a churchman named Cogitosus, who wrote the first biography of Brigid around 650 AD — some 200 years after her birth — she miraculously ended a woman’s unwanted pregnancy, “causing the fetus to disappear without coming to birth and without pain.” Another saint, Ciarán of Saigir, rescued a nun abducted by a king, according to a biography:  “When the man of God returned to the monastery with the girl, she confessed that she was pregnant. Then the man of God, led by the zeal of justice, not wishing the serpent’s seed to quicken, pressed down on her womb with the sign of the cross and forced her womb to be emptied.” Callan is quick to point out that these Irish saints weren’t champions of choice for women when it came to unwanted pregnancy, nor was it likely that these saints actually performed abortions. “The miracles show people’s attitudes toward abortion and in some circumstances it was seen as acceptable, even as a miraculous blessing.” According to Callan, the Old Irish Penitential, a book that details punishments for sins, the penance for abortion depended on the stage of pregnancy, divided into three, like trimesters: In the first, three and a half years of penance; in the second, seven years; in the third, 14 years. But as Callan put it, “pretty much everything was a sin.” The Old Irish Penitential also stipulates that oral sex merits four or five years’ penance the first time, seven years if it is repeated. “It’s not permissive. Abortion is not okay (according to these teachings). It’s just less of a sin.” The idea that life begins at conception becomes dominant in Catholic teachings only about 150 years ago, according to Callan. Previously, Catholic teachings suggested that a fetus becomes a person some weeks if not months later, once it receives a rational soul — known as “ensoulment.” This often gets associated with “quickening,” when the mother feels the fetus move for the first time, generally in the fifth month of pregnancy. It wasn’t until 1588, that Pope Sixtus V officially classified abortion, regardless of the stage of fetal development, as homicide. However, after Sixtus’s death in 1590, Pope Gregory XIV quickly rolled back the dictate, limiting it to ensouled fetuses. Why the long view is important In research for her upcoming book, Fissell said she had uncovered that “what people dislike about abortion changes immensely over time.” In ancient Rome, for example, abortion was only an issue for elite women, who were thought to be covering up adulterous relationships. In the Renaissance, abortion was linked to witchcraft. For most of history, abortion has not been an issue about the fetus, like it is today, but rather about women’s behavior. “This whole innocent unborn life that is the language of the American right today, that’s only (in recent) decades. Sometimes abortion was something people didn’t like because it pointed to illicit sex. Women have always terminated pregnancies, for as far back in the historical record we can see,” said Fissell.  “I think the long view is really important. Things were not always as they are today.”\n",
