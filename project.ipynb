    "# Final project guidelines\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Use these guidelines if and only if you are pursuing a **final project of your own design**. For those taking the final exam instead of the project, see the (separate) final exam notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Guidelines\n",
    "\n",
    "These guidelines are intended for **undergraduates enrolled in INFO 3350**. If you are a graduate student enrolled in INFO 6350, you're welcome to consult the information below, but you have wider latitude to design and develop your project in line with your research goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The task\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to: identify an interesting problem connected to the humanities or humanistic social sciences that's addressable with the help of computational methods, formulate a hypothesis about it, devise an experiment or experiments to test your hypothesis, present the results of your investigations, and discuss your findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "These tasks essentially replicate the process of writing an academic paper. You can think of your project as a paper in miniature.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are free to present each of these tasks as you see fit. You should use narrative text (that is, your own writing in a markdown cell), citations of others' work, numerical results, tables of data, and static and/or interactive visualizations as appropriate. Total length is flexible and depends on the number of people involved in the work, as well as the specific balance you strike between the ambition of your question and the sophistication of your methods. But be aware that numbers never, ever speak for themselves. Quantitative results presented without substantial discussion will not earn high marks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your project should reflect, at minimum, ten **or more** hours of work by each participant, though you will be graded on the quality of your work, not the amount of time it took you to produce it. Most high-quality projects represent twenty or more hours of work by each member.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pick an important and interesting problem!\n",
    "\n",
    "No amount of technical sophistication will overcome a fundamentally uninteresting problem at the core of your work. You have seen many pieces of successful computational humanities research over the course of the semester. You might use these as a guide to the kinds of problems that interest scholars in a range of humanities disciplines. You may also want to spend some time in the library, reading recent books and articles in the professional literature. **Problem selection and motivation are integral parts of the project.** Do not neglect them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Format\n",
    "\n",
    "You should submit your project as a Jupyter notebook, along with all data necessary to reproduce your analysis. If your dataset is too large to share easily, let us know in advance so that we can find a workaround. If you have a reason to prefer a presentation format other than a notebook, likewise let us know so that we can discuss the options.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your report should have four basic sections (provided in cells below for ease of reference):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Introduction and hypothesis.** What problem are you working on? Why is it interesting and important? What have other people said about it? What do you expect to find?\n",
    "2. **Corpus, data, and methods.** What data have you used? Where did it come from? How did you collect it? What are its limitations or omissions? What major methods will you use to analyze it? Why are those methods the appropriate ones?\n",
    "3. **Results.** What did you find? How did you find it? How should we read your figures? Be sure to include confidence intervals or other measures of statistical significance or uncetainty where appropriate.\n",
    "4. **Discussion and conclusions.** What does it all mean? Do your results support your hypothesis? Why or why not? What are the limitations of your study and how might those limitations be addressed in future work?\n",
    "\n",
    "Within each of those sections, you may use as many code and markdown cells as you like. You may, of course, address additional questions or issues not listed above.\n",
    "\n",
    "All code used in the project should be present in the notebook (except for widely-available libraries that you import), but **be sure that we can read and understand your report in full without rerunning the code**. Be sure, too, to explain what you're doing along the way, both by describing your data and methods and by writing clean, well commented code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Grading\n",
    "\n",
    "This project takes the place of the take-home final exam for the course. It is worth 35% of your overall grade. You will be graded on the quality and ambition of each aspect of the project. No single component is more important than the others.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical details\n",
    "\n",
    "* The project is due at **noon on Saturday, December 9** via upload to CMS of a single zip file containing your fully executed Jupyter notebook and all associated data.\n",
    "* You may work alone or in a group of up to three total members.\n",
    "    * If you work in a group, be sure to list the names of the group members.\n",
    "    * For groups, create your group on CMS and submit one notebook for the entire group. **Each group should also submit a statement of responsibility** that describes in general terms who performed which parts of the project.\n",
    "* You may post questions on Ed, but should do so privately (visible to course staff only).\n",
    "* Interactive visualizations do not always work when embedded in shared notebooks. If you plan to use interactives, you may need to host them elsewhere and link to them.\n",

    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the current political polarization in the United States and the relevance of the 2024 Presidential Election, the focus on media and its role in shaping public perception has never been more critical. This data project delves into the intricate web of language, word choice, and stylistic choices employed by various news outlets when reporting on abortion with a keen emphasis on political partisanship.\n",
    "\n",
    "The importance of this investigation lies in its potential to uncover implicit biases within left/right/left-leaning/right-leaning/and center media narratives and disseminated information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Media representations of the abortion debate can vary significantly, influenced by the editorial stance, values, and perspectives of the media outlets. The framing of abortion-related issues in the media often reflects broader societal attitudes, political ideologies, and cultural norms. Here are some ways media representations may differ: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Right Outlets: Media outlets with a conservative editorial stance may emphasize pro-life arguments, framing the issue as a moral and ethical concern. They might highlight the perspectives of anti-abortion activists, religious leaders, and politicians who advocate for restricting or eliminating access to abortion.\n",
    "- Left Outlets: Conversely, liberal-leaning media may emphasize reproductive rights and women's autonomy, framing the issue as a matter of personal choice and healthcare. They may prioritize stories that shed light on the potential consequences of restrictive abortion laws on women's health and well-being.\n",
    "- Neutral Terminology vs. Loaded Language: Media outlets may use neutral or loaded language to describe abortion-related topics. The terms \"pro-choice\" and \"pro-life\" themselves carry inherent biases, and the choice of words can influence how the audience perceives the issue.\n",
    "- Selection BIas: Some outlets may prioritize human-interest stories, featuring personal narratives of individuals affected by abortion decisions. Others might focus more on policy analysis, examining the legal, political, and social implications of changes to abortion laws.\n",
    "- Representation of Diverse Perspectives: Media outlets may vary in their efforts to represent a diverse range of voices within the abortion debate. Some outlets may actively seek perspectives from women who have had abortions, medical professionals, religious leaders, and activists on both sides of the issue. Others may unintentionally amplify certain voices over others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding these potential differences in media representations is crucial for media literacy and fostering a nuanced understanding of the abortion debate, especially as it has become a spotlighted topic after the Supreme Court made a historic decision to uphold a restrictive abortion law in Mississippi (Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization), which many see as a significant step toward overturning or severely limiting Roe v. Wade.\n",
    "\n",
    "The significance of this project holds implications for media literacy and exploring how citizens should be aware of potential echo chambers in media consumption. \n",
    "\n",
    "As we examine the selective diction, sentiment connotations, clustering, and similarity used to describe events among presidential debate speeches, abortion congressional bills, and 5 news outlets, this project seeks to discern patterns that determine whether choice of words or coverage of events indicates a leaning towards a particular political party. \n",
    "Simultaneously, we conduct a comparative analysis of language used by different media outlets (across the political spectrum) when covering the same events, unraveling distinct narratives crafted by left-wing and right-wing sources to evaluate the implications of these differing perspectives. Secondly, the exploration extends beyond mere observation, delving into whether certain events are portrayed with a comparably positive or negative bias, contributing to the broader discourse on media objectivity.\n"

    "## 2. Research Question and Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "We hypothesize that there is an association between the language and style employed by news outlets in reporting current events revolving around abortion and political partisanship (whether a news outlet is left or right leaning.)\n",
    "\n",
    "We anticapate a positive association between the language and style employed by news outlets in reporting abortion current events and political partisanship. Specifically, we anticipate that news outlets leaning towards a particular political party or ideology will use language and style that align with the ideologies of that party.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Research Question \n",
    "\n",
    "Do news outlets' language and style in reporting current events surrounding abortion correlate with political partisanship? How much do these language choices link to the perceived positivity or negativity of specific events?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important Note\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of U.S. politics, the terms \"left\" and \"right\" are commonly used to denote the ideological spectrum, with the Democratic Party generally associated with the left and the Republican Party with the right. While understanding the specific nuances of politicians and news outlets' political ideology and dynamic is beyond the scope of this project, we acknowledge that a more comprehensive and accurate analysis could be made if there was an exploration of diversity amongst the ideologies of the Democratic and Republican parties. In the context of the project, however, using terms like \"left\" for Democrats and \"right\" for Republicans is a common and broadly accepted shorthand and will dictate our methodology. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Methdology \n",
    "\n",
    "Our methodology to answer our hypothesis and research question is below. \n",
    "\n",
    "-  **Data Collection** \n",
    "   1. Scrap text data from political speeches from both Democratic and Republican parties during Presidential debates since the 2000. These exercepts from speeches will need to mention \"abortion\" specifically. \n",
    "   2. Scrap Congressional bills proposed regarding abortion by both the Democratic and Republican party in the 118th Congress (2022-2023 year).\n",
    "   3. Gather text data with relevance to abortion from five media outlets (CNN, NYT, WSJ, NYP, FOX) of varying political and editorial slants. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Top Words**\n",
    "   1. Analyze the top words and their frequencies utilized for presidential debates, congressional bills, and the media outlets \n",
    "\n",
    "- **VADER Sentiment Analysis**\n",
    "   1. Conduct a sentiment analysis using VADER to highlight the positivity/negativing surrounding the word choice in presidential debates, congressional bills, and media outlets\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fighting Words**\n",
    "   1. Sourcing from existing research and literature review on lexical feature selection to identify political conflict(https://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/Monroe.pdf), we will utilize 'fightin' words' method to examine the top words and their scores for media outlets. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Similarity**\n",
    "   1. Examine similarity among sentences of presidential speeches, congressional bills, and media outlets using cosine distances.\n",
    "   \n",
    "- **Clustering**\n",
    "   1. Examine clustering among presidential speeches, congressional bills, and media outlets to highlight similar features and similarity that showcase the political partisanship in word choice, which could explain the political slants and dictation chosen by media outlets that are left/left-leaning/center/right-leaning/right.\n",
    "   \n",
    "- **BERT Classification and Predictions**\n",
    "   1. Using words used in presidential speeches and congressional bills, we aim to create a BERT classification model to predict whether a news article is left or right. \n",
    "   2. We will then compare the prediction to the political affiliation of the news outlet (left/left-leaning/center/right-leaning/right) and analyze whether word choice can showcase political slants, answering our hypothesis question. \n",
    "   \n",
    "### Selected News Outlets \n",
    "\n",
    "Sourcing from AllSides' media bias chart, we chose 1 news outlet from each category (left/left-leaning/center/right-leaning/right). We chose the news outlet that is most relevant in terms of overall daily reads and user consumption both in print and online. We also used other sources (https://www.pewresearch.org/journalism/2014/10/21/section-1-media-sources-distinct-favorites-emerge-on-the-left-and-right/) to help us choose the media outlets we will examine. \n",

    "\n",
    "Women:\n",
    "\n",
    "The frequent use of \"women\" suggests a focus on women's issues, potentially including healthcare, reproductive rights, gender equality, and other topics relevant to women.\n",
    "Right:\n",
    "\n",
    "The context of \"right\" is crucial to understand. It could be associated with individual rights, civil rights, or possibly references to political ideologies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Faith:\n",
    "\n",
    "The mention of \"faith\" indicates a potential emphasis on the role of faith in political discourse. This could relate to the importance of religious freedom or the values that candidates connect with their faith. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is an interesting find in the speeches of democratic and left-leaning candidates and contrary to current discourse on how faith and religion plays a role in the abortion debate. Perhaps, liberal candidates, in an attempt, to garner the support of right-leaning or Republican voters, mention \"faith\" and religion to appeal to them, despite the difference in opinion for abortion rights.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Life:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Life\" is a term often associated with discussions about abortion, healthcare, or broader social and ethical considerations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Catholic:\n",
    "\n",
    "The mention of \"Catholic\" suggests a connection to candidates' religious affiliations, which might influence their policy positions or values. The same analysis from the word \"faith\" can be applied here \n",
    "\n",
    "Issue:\n",
    "\n",
    "The word \"issue\" is broad and could encompass a range of topics, including policy matters, challenges, and concerns addressed by the candidates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Court:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Court\" may be associated with discussions about judicial appointments, Supreme Court decisions, or the broader legal landscape. This is usually accompanied by the ruling on Roe v. Wade, which the Democratic party mentions a lot. \n",
    "\n",
    "Choice and Decision:\n",
    "\n",
    "The repetition of \"choice\" and \"decision\" may point to a focus on individual autonomy, particularly in areas like healthcare choices and personal decisions.\n",
    "Health:\n",
    "\n",
    "The mention of \"health\" suggests a focus on healthcare-related issues, which is a significant and often debated topic in political discourse.\n",
    "\n",
    "Support and Respect:\n",
    "\n",
    "The use of \"support\" and \"respect\" signals an emphasis on values related to empathy, understanding, and advocacy for various causes."

Both have a significant neutral (neu) component, suggesting a balanced mix of positive and negative expressions. The Right sentiment has a slightly higher positive score (pos) compared to the Left sentiment, indicating a slightly more positive tone. The compound scores for both sentiments are close to 1, indicating highly positive overall sentiment. These results suggest that, based on the VADER sentiment analysis, both Left and Right sentiments exhibit a predominantly positive tone, with the Right sentiment leaning slightly more positive. The high compound scores reinforce the overall positive sentiment in the analyzed text data.\n",

    "This aligns well with the context of presidential elections. In political discourse, especially during election campaigns, candidates and their supporters often convey messages with a positive tone to inspire confidence, garner support, and present a favorable image to the public. The prevalence of positive sentiment in both Democratic (Left) and Republican (Right) sentiments indicates an effort to convey optimism, enthusiasm, and confidence in their respective political narratives."

I 118th CONGRESS 1st Session H. R. 632 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES January 30, 2023 Mr. Norman (for himself, Mr. Duncan , Mr. Gaetz , Mrs. Miller of Illinois , Mr. Allen , Mr. Sessions , Mr. Carl , Mr. Cloud , Mr. Waltz , Mr. Lamborn , Mr. Luetkemeyer , Mr. Banks , Mr. Aderholt , Mr. Palmer , Mrs. Harshbarger , Mr. Johnson of Louisiana , Mr. Gosar , Mr. Biggs , Mr. Bishop of North Carolina , Mr. Wenstrup , Mr. Rosendale , Mr. Westerman , Mr. Moolenaar , Mr. Santos , Mr. Weber of Texas , Mr. Kelly of Mississippi , Mr. Moylan , Mr. Good of Virginia , Mr. Webster of Florida , and Mr. Mooney ) introduced the following bill; which was referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce A BILL To amend title XIX of the Social Security Act and Public Health Service Act to improve the reporting of abortion data to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and for other purposes. 1. Short title This Act may be cited as the Ensuring Accurate and Complete Abortion Data Reporting Act of 2023 . 2. Findings Congress finds the following: (1) Reporting abortion data has been voluntary in the past, which has not resulted in complete data being submitted to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. (2) While the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention requests specific data points from each State and the District of Columbia, there is a great variety in the information collected and published by the States. (3) In fact, there is not a single abortion data point publicly reported for all fifty States and the District of Columbia. (4) Even more alarming, three States that together account for 15 percent of the United States population of women of childbearing age do not report any abortion data to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. (5) Accurate statistical data regarding abortion and those who survive abortion attempts is critical to public health and policy analysis. 3.

(2) Late submission of reports With respect to a year, in the case of a State that does not submit by December 31 of the previous year the abortion data required under paragraph (1) with respect to the year before the previous year but submits such data by December 31 of the year, such State shall continue to receive payment, including retroactive payment, under subsection (a)(5) with respect to any amount expended during the year for family planning services and supplies described in section 1905(a)(4)(C) furnished to an individual described in such paragraph. (3) Certification of abortion data (A) In general With respect to each submission of abortion data under this subsection, a State shall certify to the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that such data is accurate. (B) False information In the case that the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention determines that a State has knowingly provided false information with respect to a submission of abortion data under this subsection, such State may not receive payment under subsection (a)(5) with respect to any amount expended during the first full fiscal year following such determination for family planning services and supplies described in section 1905(a)(4)(C) furnished to an individual described in paragraph (1). . 4.

(b) Variables The variables listed in this subsection are the following: (1) Maternal age in years. (2) Gestational age in completed weeks at the time of abortion. (3) Maternal race.

Prohibition on payment and reimbursement by Department of Defense of expenses relating to abortion services (a) Sense of Congress It is the sense of Congress that— (1) consistent with section 1093 of title 10, United States Code, the Department of Defense may not use any funds for abortions except where the life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term or in a case in which the pregnancy is the result of an act of rape or incest; (2) the Secretary of Defense has no legal authority to implement any policies in which funds are to be used for such purpose; and (3) the Department of Defense Memorandum titled Ensuring Access to Reproductive Health Care , dated October 20, 2022, is therefore unlawful and must be rescinded.

I 118th CONGRESS 1st Session H. R. 5806 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES September 28, 2023 Mr. Ogles (for himself, Mrs. Harshbarger , Mr. Duncan , Mr. Weber of Texas , Mrs. Miller of Illinois , Mr. Moore of Alabama , Mr. Kelly of Mississippi , Mr. Gosar , Mr. Arrington , Mr. Crenshaw , Mr. Clyde , Mr. Allen , Mr. Self , and Mr. Aderholt ) introduced the following bill; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary A BILL To amend title 18, United States Code, to prohibit chemical abortions, and for other purposes. 1. Short title This Act may be cited as the Ending Chemical Abortions Act of 2023 . 2. Findings Congress finds the following: (1) In 2000, the Food and Drug Administration approved chemical abortion drugs for use in the United States. The agency illegally categorized pregnancy as an illness and asserted chemical abortion drugs provide a meaningful therapeutic benefit. (2) In 2016, the Food and Drug Administration reduced the number of doctor visits required for administration of chemical abortion drugs from 3 visits to 1 visit. The agency also removed the requirement for both the in-person administration of misoprostol and a subsequent follow-up appointment. At this time, the agency also expanded the availability of inducing a chemical abortion from 7 to 10 weeks. (3) In 2021, the Food and Drug Administration eliminated the in-person dispensing requirement for chemical abortion drugs, purporting to allow these drugs to be dispensed by mail in violation of longstanding Federal law. (4) When compared to surgical abortions, chemical abortions are consistently more likely to result in complications that are miscoded as a spontaneous abortion or miscarriage . (5) According to the Guttmacher Institute, the Abortion Industry’s think tank, since 2000, the administration of mifepristone and misoprostol has grown to comprise over 50 percent of all induced abortions in the United States. (6) There is a four times higher risk of experiencing complications due to a chemical abortion than a surgical abortion. 3.

    "Increased Restrictions on Abortion:\n",
    "\n",
    "The bills may propose additional restrictions on abortion rights, such as imposing stricter regulations, implementing waiting periods, or limiting the gestational age at which abortions can be performed. Such measures might be perceived as encroachments on women's reproductive rights and autonomy.\n",
    "Cross-State Restrictions:\n",

    "If the bills include provisions that restrict individuals from traveling to other states for abortion services, it could be seen as an infringement on personal freedom and the right to access healthcare.\n",
    "Lack of Exceptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Negative sentiment may arise if the bills inadequately address exceptions to abortion, such as cases involving rape, incest, or situations where the mother's health is at risk. A lack of flexibility in these areas might be a point of contention.\n",
    "\n",
    "This aligns with predictions and the top words below as many of these bills talk about preventative measures for abortions through more stringent laws."

I 118th CONGRESS 1st Session H. R. 4303 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES June 22, 2023 Ms. Pressley (for herself, Ms. Williams of Georgia , Ms. Escobar , Ms. Bush , and Mr. Frost ) introduced the following bill; which was referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce , and in addition to the Committees on Ways and Means , the Judiciary , Natural Resources , Armed Services , Veterans' Affairs , Oversight and Accountability , and Foreign Affairs , for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned A BILL To expand access to abortion care. 1. Short title This Act may be cited as the Abortion Justice Act of 2023 . 2. Findings Congress finds the following: (1) Abortion care is essential health care that should be affordable, available, and supported for everyone who needs it. (2) On June 24, 2022, the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and 50 years of legal precedent, and Roe v. Wade was never enough. Without the ability to access abortion, the legal right did not help many people working to make ends meet, who are Black, Indigenous, Asian, Pacific Islander, Latinx, young people, LGBTQ+ people, immigrants, disabled people and gender nonconforming people. (3) Almost one-third (29 percent) of the total United States population of women of reproductive age are currently living in States where abortion is either unavailable or severely restricted and a dozen other States are certain or likely to ban abortion in the future. (4) Systemic racism, economic insecurity, abelism, and a dehumanizing immigration system exacerbate the already-massive barriers to abortion care. (5) While abortion bans and other legal restrictions harm all people who are or may become pregnant, they cause even greater harm to those already subject to systemic racism and economic injustice. (6) Pregnancy is less safe for some than others because of historic and ongoing racism and discrimination in health care settings, and Black and Indigenous individuals face two to three times the risk of dying from pregnancy-related causes. Individuals in States banning or severely restricting access to abortion care also have worse maternal health outcomes. (7) Forced pregnancy is always unconscionable, and particularly so for individuals facing heightened risk of maternal mortality and morbidity, where pregnancy is less safe for some than others because of historic and ongoing racism and discrimination in health care settings. (8) Maternal deaths in 2020 were 62 percent higher in States where abortion is heavily restricted than in States where abortion was available, and a Federal ban on abortion would increase maternal mortality by an estimated 24 percent. (9) Congress has the authority to act pursuant to the commerce clause, the necessary and proper clause, and section 5 of the 14th Amendment. (10) Attacks on bodily autonomy are not limited to threats on abortion care. This year alone, more than 120 bills have been introduced attacking gender-affirming care. States have attempted to outlaw many forms of birth control, and 15 States have near total abortion bans. (11) Several State courts have found that abortion restrictions violate the right to bodily autonomy. (12) The criminalization of abortion care forces people to travel hundreds of miles out of their community to try to get care. (13) As in other forms of criminalization, the people targeted for pregnancy loss and self-managed abortion prosecution are disproportionately people of color, immigrants, and people experiencing economic insecurity. (14) Throughout the more than 20 years that it has been used in the United States, medication abortion has been proven to be overwhelmingly safe and effective, and has expanded the way people choose to self manage their abortion. (15) All Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs must be available in all States and territories. (16) Research shows that with access to safe, effective methods and accurate information, people may safely self-manage an abortion on their own. Anyone who decides to end a pregnancy should be able to choose to self-manage an abortion at home with medical guidance and the support they want. (17) Abortion needs to be accessible where people live and where they access health care. For young adults on college campuses, student health centers are often where they access the full range of care they need, and medication abortion must be accessible and available to young adults who get their health insurance through their State colleges and universities, and three States (Massachusetts, New York, and California) have passed laws ensuring access to medication abortion on college campuses. (18) States have continually crafted legal restrictions to ensure that abortion care is burdensome or impossible to obtain. This strategy has led to more than 1,300 abortion restrictions enacted since Roe v. Wade was originally decided in 1973. These attacks are rooted in racism and compound the failures of the health care and economic systems to provide communities living with low incomes access to high-quality, affordable health care, and safe and sustainable communities. (19) A lack of investment in both telehealth and reproductive health care is a significant barrier to an equitable experience of telehealth for medication abortion care. Actualizing the promise of telehealth and technology requires centering equity by investing in broadband, cultural competency, health literacy, and digital and physical infrastructure development. (20) Bans on insurance coverage of abortion compound barriers to health care access for immigrant and migrant communities, which can also include logistical barriers like travel costs and distance to clinics, lodging needs and costs, childcare costs and availability, limited access to translation services, culturally competent care inclusive of low-literacy services, lost wages, and lack of paid time off for health care appointments can all delay or prohibit abortion care. (21) Nearly two out of three people live within the 100-mile border zone that allows for interior Customs and Border Protection checkpoints where immigration officers have increased discretion to detain and question individuals. (22) Immigrants of all statuses and people who are undocumented or in mixed-status families are deprived of the freedom to travel because of in-State immigration checkpoints that put them at even greater risk of criminalization, all of which contribute to a chilling effect for abortion access due to heightened threats of family separation, detention, and deportation. (23) In 2019, noncitizen immigrants aged 15 to 49 had three times the uninsured rate of naturalized citizens or people born in the United States (36 percent vs. 12 percent), and immigrants with low incomes fared worse, where in 2019 50 percent of noncitizen immigrants aged 15 to 49 with a family income below the Federal poverty level (earning less than $21,330 for a family of three) were uninsured. (24) People held in immigration detention centers who are separated from their children and families face additional barriers to abortion care because of financial barriers due to the abortion coverage bans and other restrictions. (25) On November 10, 2022, the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) issued new guidance to ensure that unaccompanied immigrant minors have access to abortion while in ORR custody awaiting reunification with family in the United States. The Federal Government should implement policies regarding the detention of pregnant, postpartum, and nursing people, to ensure that no pregnant person is detained and if such detention occurs, that there is no barrier to abortion while detained regardless of the detaining agency. (26) More than 40 percent of youth and children under age 19 and 12 percent of young people age 19 to 25 have health insurance through government programs. (27) Pregnant people younger than 18 face additional barriers to accessing abortion care. (28) Young people face parental involvement laws in 22 States where abortion is still available, or the exercise of a judicial bypass which requires minors to receive court approval to access abortion care when they do not have their parents’ knowledge or consent. (29) Judicial bypass is not a meaningful alternative but instead another hurdle faced by young people. Many minors do not know judicial bypass is available or do not know how to get it, do not have access to transportation to travel to the necessary courts, or simply are denied bypass by resistant or biased judges. (30) Abortion is one of the safest medical procedures in the country and leading public health organizations such as the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Medical Association, and the American Academy of Family Physicians strongly oppose efforts to impede access to abortion care or interfere in the relationship between a person and health care provider. (31) The 2022 Violence and Disruption Report of the National Abortion Federation found an alarming escalation in incidents of obstruction, vandalism, and trespassing at abortion clinics, with abortion providers reporting an alarming rate of death threats and threats of harm, and documented 218 incidents in 2022, a 20-percent increase in death threats and threats of harm over 2021. (32) Black, Indigenous, and other providers and patients of color face heightened levels of threats, harassment, and violence as compared to their White counterparts. (33) In the face of multifaceted attacks on their work, abortion providers remain an essential and valued part of their communities, providing high-quality, compassionate, and necessary health care. (34) There is a critical shortage of health care providers, including abortion care providers, and it is estimated that 28 percent of OB/GYN residency programs are based in States or territories that are currently enforcing abortion bans. (35) Residents desiring abortion care training living in hostile States are forced to travel to States without abortion restrictions. (36) Abortion care training residents face barriers to training including obtaining licensure and liability insurance, making it difficult for the next generation of abortion providers to provide comprehensive sexual and reproductive health care in their communities. (37) In the face of the fear and stigma following the Dobbs decision, health care facilities have denied patients lawful emergency care because of the similarities in abortion care and miscarriage management. (38) 91 facilities that provide abortion care have closed since the Supreme Court’s decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization. Of these, 62 facilities closed as a direct consequence of Dobbs and enforced or anticipated abortion bans. (39) The ability to meaningfully access abortion gives meaning to the right to abortion. (40) In the United States there is an existing support network, including abortion funds, providers, doulas, and many more, to help abortion seekers access care and navigate restrictions with expertise in providing patient-centered care. (41) Investments to improve telehealth would improve care for people with barriers to accessing in-person care, people with disabilities, and rural communities, by providing expanded autonomy and decreased barriers to access. (42) Creating more opportunities for telehealth services should not substitute building much needed capacity for high-quality, in-person care, particularly in underserved rural, low-income, and Black, Indigenous, and people of color communities. (43) Removing Federal restrictions to abortion training and investing in clinic infrastructure, including clinic security, will allow more people to provide and more people to access abortion in a safe and healthy environment and help to alleviate the drastic shortage in abortion providers. (44) Critical investments in evidence-based, patient-centered research and innovation is needed to ensure abortion care continues to meet the needs of patients across the country and will help to improve access and quality of care. 3. Grant for funding to support individuals who need to access abortion care (a) In general The Secretary of Health and Human Services (in this section referred to as the Secretary ) shall award grants to entities to increase abortion access or to support individuals who need access to abortion care.

Short title This Act may be cited as the Abortion is Health Care Everywhere Act of 2023 . 2. Findings Congress makes the following findings: (1) Abortion is a critical component of sexual and reproductive health care and should be accessible and affordable for all people. (2) All people have the right to make their own choices about their sexual and reproductive health, and to access quality and affordable sexual and reproductive health care. International agreements have recognized reproductive rights for over 25 years, and the 2015 Sustainable Development Goals reiterated the centrality of reproductive rights to gender equality. (3) Studies have repeatedly demonstrated that when people, including young women and adolescent girls, gender non-conforming individuals, and transgender men, are able to control their reproductive lives, there are enormous social and economic benefits—not just for the individual and their family, but for entire communities. Countries that prioritize reproductive health, rights, and justice and human rights are more likely to have better overall health throughout. (4) Health system cost is reduced when abortion is widely available and integrated with other types of health care. (5) Without access to safe abortion care, people risk their lives to end their pregnancies. At least 24,100 people in low- and middle-income countries die every year from complications from unsafe abortion. (6) Ninety-seven percent of unsafe abortions occur in developing countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. In low- and middle-income countries, the annual cost of post-abortion care for all who need it would be $4 billion. The majority of this cost is attributed to treating complications from abortions provided in unsafe conditions. (7) Restricting abortion does not reduce either the need for or number of abortions. Abortion rates are similar in countries where it is highly restricted by law and where it is broadly legal. (8) As part of their commitment to prevent unsafe abortions and preventable deaths and ensure all people have access to comprehensive sexual and reproductive health care and can exercise their right to full control over their sexuality and reproduction, developing countries and donor governments must work collaboratively to deploy funding, align policies, and mobilize expertise to make safe abortion services available to those seeking to terminate pregnancies. (9) United States law restricting United States foreign assistance funding from being used to provide safe abortion services has the effect of harming people who seek to terminate their pregnancies in several ways, including by blocking access to services and erecting barriers to providers obtaining the training and equipment needed to deliver care to those in need. (10) Since section 104(f)(1) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 ( 22 U.S.C. 2151b(f)(1) ) (commonly referred to as the Helms amendment ) was enacted in 1973, dozens of governments across the globe have liberalized abortion laws and policies. (11) In countries where the United States supports family planning and reproductive health care and in which abortion is legal on at least some grounds, support for safe abortion could avert over 19 million unsafe abortions and 17,000 maternal deaths each year. (12) When abortions are performed in accordance with the World Health Organization (WHO) guideline and standards, it is a simple and safe procedure. The most recent WHO abortion guidelines recommend the full decriminalization of abortion and removal of grounds-based restrictions on abortion. (13) The Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision goes against the global trend toward expanding access to sexual and reproductive health and rights, including abortion, and negatively impacts abortion access across the United States and globally. The decision has emboldened anti-rights actors, increased abortion stigma, and created new challenges for countries that have relied on the Roe v. Wade decision in the liberalization of their own laws. 3. Statement of policy The following shall be the policy of the United States Government: (1) Safe abortion is a critical component of comprehensive maternal and reproductive health care and should be included as part of foreign assistance programs funded by the United States Government. (2) Safe abortion is to be made widely available and integrated with other types of health care. (3) The United States Government should work to end unsafe abortion and promote safe abortion services by providing funding and collaborating with affected governments and service providers to provide training, commodities and equipment, and access to safe abortion services. 4. Use of funds for comprehensive reproductive health care services Section 104 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 ( 22 U.S.C. 2151b ) is amended— (1) in subsection (f)— (A) by striking paragraph (1); and (B) by redesignating paragraphs (2) and (3) as paragraphs (1) and (2), respectively; (2) by redesignating subsection (g) as subsection (h); and (3) by inserting after subsection (f), as amended, the following: (g) Use of funds for comprehensive reproductive health care services Notwithstanding any other provision of law, funds made available to carry out this part may be used to provide comprehensive reproductive health care services, including abortion services, training, and equipment. . 111 HR 561 IH: Equal Access to Abortion Coverage in Health Insurance Act of 2023 U.S. House of Representatives 2023-01-26 text/xml EN Pursuant to Title 17 Section 105 of the United States Code, this file is not subject to copyright protection and is in the public domain.

Short title This Act may be cited as the Equal Access to Abortion Coverage in Health Insurance Act of 2023 or the EACH Act of 2023 . 2. Findings Congress makes the following findings: (1) All people should have access to abortion services regardless of actual or perceived race, color, ethnicity, language, ancestry, citizenship, immigration status, sex (including a sex stereotype; pregnancy, childbirth, or a related medical condition; sexual orientation or gender identity; and sex characteristics), age, disability, or sex work status or behavior. (2) A person’s income level, wealth, or type of insurance should not prevent them from having access to a full range of pregnancy-related health care, including abortion services. (3) No person should have the decision to have, or not to have, an abortion made for them based on the ability or inability to afford the health care service. (4) Since 1976, the Federal Government has banned the use of Federal funds to pay for abortion services and allows for exceptions only in very narrow circumstances. This ban affects people of reproductive age in the United States who are insured through the Medicaid program, as well as individuals who receive insurance or care through other federally funded health programs and plans. (5) Women make up the majority of Medicaid enrollees (54 percent) and, in 2019, approximately 14 million women of reproductive age relied on the program for care. Due to systematic barriers and discrimination, a disproportionately higher number of women of color and Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, or Queer (LGBTQ) individuals are enrolled in the program. (6) Women of color are more likely to be insured by the Medicaid program. Nationwide, 29 percent of Black women and 25 percent of Hispanic women aged 15–49 were enrolled in Medicaid in 2018, compared with 15 percent of White women. (7) In the aggregate, nearly one-fifth (19 percent) of Asian American and Pacific Islander women are enrolled in the Medicaid program, while enrollment rates for certain Asian ethnic subgroups are much higher (at 62 percent of Bhutanese women, 43 percent of Hmong women and 32 percent of Pakistani women). (8) Medicaid also provides coverage to more than one in four (27 percent) nonelderly American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN) adults and half of AIAN children. (9) In a 2014 nationwide survey of LGBT people with incomes less than 400 percent Federal Poverty Level (FPL), 61 percent of all respondents had incomes in the Medicaid expansion range—up to 138 percent of the FPL—including 73 percent of African-American respondents, 67 percent of Latino respondents, and 53 percent of White respondents. Another survey found that 32 percent of Asian and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander transgender people were living in poverty. (10) Of women aged 15–44 enrolled in Medicaid in 2018, 55 percent lived in the 34 States and the District of Columbia where Medicaid does not cover abortion services except in limited circumstances. This amounted to 7.2 million women of reproductive age, including 3 million women living below the FPL. Of this population, Black, Indigenous, and other People of Color (BIPOC) women accounted for 51 percent of those enrolled. (11) The Indian Health Service (IHS) is the federally funded health program for American Indians and Alaska Natives. The IHS serves a population of approximately 2.56 million and as a federally funded system, since 1988, it has been barred from providing abortion services except for very limited cases. American Indians and Alaska Natives often face higher levels of poverty and limited access to health care for a number of intersecting oppressions thus leaving them without recourse for the Federal ban on abortion services. (12) Moreover, 26 States also prohibit coverage of abortion services in the marketplaces and 11 prohibit coverage in private health insurance plans under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 ( Public Law 111–148 ). (13) A recent report details how restrictions on abortion services coverage interfere with a person’s individual decisionmaking, with their health and well-being, with their economic security, with their vulnerability to intimate partner violence, and with their constitutionally protected right to a safe and normal health care service. (14) About 25 percent of women covered by Medicaid seeking abortion services must carry their pregnancies to term because they are unable to obtain funds for their care. Government-imposed barriers to abortion services restrict people’s decisions on if, when, and how to parent, and have long-lasting and life-altering harmful effects on the pregnant person, their families and their communities. Those who seek and are denied abortion services are more likely to remain in or fall into poverty than those who access the care they need. (15) Restrictions on abortion service coverage have a disproportionately harmful impact on women with low incomes, women of color, immigrant women, LGBTQ people, and young women. Additionally, numerous state-imposed barriers make it disparately difficult for low-income people, people of color, immigrants, LGBTQ people, and young people to access the health care and resources necessary to prevent unintended pregnancy or to assure that they are able to carry healthy pregnancies to term. Furthermore, young people of reproductive age (15–24) are more likely to have a lower income than those older than that, and this income gap is greater for young BIPOC. More than 40 percent of youth and children under age 19 and almost a quarter of young people age 19 to 25 have health insurance through government programs. Without insurance coverage for abortion services, young people are at greater risk of not having the economic means to afford care outside of insurance. Young people face disproportionate access barriers to abortion including parental involvement requirement (notification and consent) and cost, in addition to barriers to contraception and inadequate and incomplete sexual(ity) education. These challenges, which are magnified for BIPOC and queer, trans, and nonbinary youth, can cause significant delays in access to needed care, and could ultimately harm the life of the young person seeking abortion services. These institutionalized barriers deny young people’s right to bodily autonomy and can force young people to encounter an abusive parent or guardian, ignores trusted relationships young people may have with adults other than a parent or legal guardian, and in the case of the judicial bypass process, may force young BIPOC to interact with a legal system that has historically targeted and caused harm to communities of color. (16) These and other government-created and government-institutionalized barriers—including the restriction on funding for abortion services in Federal programs—exacerbate and create poverty and racial inequality in income, wealth-generation, and access to services. (17) Access to health care, including abortion services, promotes the general welfare of people living in the United States. Singling out abortion services for funding restrictions in health care programs otherwise designed to promote the health and well-being of people in the United States has cost pregnant people their lives, their livelihoods, their ability to obtain or maintain economic security for themselves and their families, their ability to meet their family’s basic needs, their ability to continue their education without disruption, and their ability to break free of abusive relationships. (18) Like other health care and health insurance markets in the United States, abortion services and public insurance programs are commercial activities that affect interstate commerce. Providers and patients travel across State lines, and otherwise engage in interstate commerce, to provide and access abortion services. Material goods, services, and federally regulated medications used in abortion services circulate in interstate commerce. (19) Congress has the authority to enact this Act to ensure affordable coverage of abortion and other services pursuant to— (A) its powers under the necessary and proper clause of section 8, article I of the Constitution of the United States; (B) its powers under the commerce clause of section 8, article 1 of the Constitution of the United States; (C) its powers to tax and spend for the general welfare under section 8, article 1 of the Constitution of the United States; and (D) its powers to enforce section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment under section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. (20) Congress has exercised these constitutional powers to create, expand, and insure health care access for people in the United States for decades. Pursuant to this constitutional authority, Congress has enacted, and subsequently reauthorized, numerous health care programs including but not limited to title XVIII of the Social Security Act of 1965 (Medicare); title XIX of the Social Security Act of 1965 (Medicaid); and title XXI of the Social Security Act (Children’s Health Insurance Program, enacted in 1997). 3.

Short title This Act may be cited as the Women’s Health Protection Act of 2023 . 2. Findings Congress finds the following: (1) Abortion services are essential health care, and access to those services is central to people’s ability to participate equally in the economic and social life of the United States. Abortion access allows people who are pregnant to make their own decisions about their pregnancies, their families, and their lives. (2) Reproductive justice requires every individual to have the right to make their own decisions about having children regardless of their circumstances and without interference and discrimination. Reproductive justice is a human right that can and will be achieved when all people, regardless of actual or perceived race, color, national origin, immigration status, sex (including gender identity, sex stereotyping, or sexual orientation), age, or disability status have the economic, social, and political power and resources to define and make decisions about their bodies, health, sexuality, families, and communities in all areas of their lives, with dignity and self-determination. (3) Abortion care, like all health care, is a human right that should not depend on one’s ZIP Code or region, age, actual or perceived race, national origin, immigration status, sex, or disability status. Unfortunately, this is the current reality for millions, creating a patchwork of abortion access across the United States. Protecting the right to determine whether to continue or end a pregnancy, and the right of health care providers to provide abortion care, is necessary and essential to achieving this human right, and ultimately reproductive justice. (4) On June 24, 2022, in its decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, the Supreme Court overruled Roe v. Wade, reversing decades of precedent recognizing a constitutional right to terminate a pregnancy before fetal viability. (5) The effects of the Dobbs decision were immediate and disastrous. In the aftermath of the Dobbs decision, many States imposed near-total bans on abortion. As of March 2023, abortion is unavailable in 14 States, leaving 17.8 million women of reproductive age (15–49) and transgender and gender nonconforming individuals with the capacity to become pregnant without abortion access in their home State. Within 100 days of the ruling, 66 clinics across 15 States were forced to stop offering abortions. (6) Travel time to an abortion clinic, already a burden for abortion seekers under Roe, has more than tripled since Dobbs. As distance to an abortion facility increases, so do the accompanying (and potentially prohibitive) burdens of time off work or school, lost wages, transportation costs, lodging, child care costs, and other ancillary costs. (7) Even before the Dobbs decision, access to abortion services had long been obstructed across the United States in various ways, including: prohibitions of, and restrictions on, insurance coverage; mandatory parental involvement laws; restrictions that shame and stigmatize people seeking abortion services; and medically unnecessary regulations that fail to further the safety of abortion services, but instead cause harm people by delaying, complicating access to, and reducing the availability of, abortion services. (8) Being denied an abortion can have serious consequences for people’s physical, mental, and economic health and well-being, and that of their families. According to the Turnaway Study, a longitudinal study published by Advancing New Standards In Reproductive Health (ANSIRH) in 2019, individuals who are denied a wanted abortion are more likely to experience economic insecurity than individuals who receive a wanted abortion. After following participants for five years, the study found that people who were denied abortion care were more likely to live in poverty, experience debt, and have lower credit scores for several years after the denial. These findings demonstrate that when people have control over when to have children and how many children to have, their children benefit through increased economic security and better maternal bonding. (9) Abortion bans and restrictions have repercussions for a broad range of health care beyond pregnancy termination, including exacerbating the existing maternal health crisis facing the United States. The United States has the highest maternal mortality rate of any industrialized nations, and Black women and birthing people face three times the risk of dying from pregnancy related causes as their white counterparts. Even prior to Dobbs, research found that States that enacted abortion restrictions based on gestation increased their maternal mortality rate by 38 percent. Research has found that a nationwide ban would increase the United States maternal mortality rate by an additional 24 percent. Furthermore, States that have banned, are planning to ban, or have severely restricted abortion care have fewer maternal health providers, more maternity care deserts, higher rates of both maternal and infant mortality, and greater racial inequity in health care. (10) Abortion bans and restrictions additionally harm people’s health by reducing access to other essential health care services offered by many of the providers targeted by the restrictions, including— (A) screenings and preventive services, including contraceptive services; (B) testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections; (C) LGBTQ health services; and (D) referrals for primary care, intimate partner violence prevention, prenatal care, and adoption services. (11) This ripple effect has only worsened since the Dobbs decision. Clinicians and pharmacists have denied access to essential medication for conditions including gastric ulcers and autoimmune diseases because those drugs are also used for medication abortion care. Patients are reporting being denied or delayed in their receipt of necessary and potentially lifesaving treatment for ectopic pregnancies and miscarriage management because of the newfound legal risks facing providers. (12) Reproductive justice seeks to address restrictions on reproductive health, including abortion, that perpetuate systems of oppression, lack of bodily autonomy, white supremacy, and anti-Black racism. This violent legacy has manifested in policies including enslavement, rape, and experimentation on Black women; forced sterilizations, medical experimentation on low-income women’s reproductive systems; and the forcible removal of Indigenous children. Access to equitable reproductive health care, including abortion services, has always been deficient in the United States for Black, Indigenous, Latina/x, Asian American and Pacific Islander, and People of Color (BIPOC) and their families. (13) The legacy of restrictions on reproductive health, rights, and justice is not a dated vestige of a dark history. Data show the harms of abortion-specific restrictions fall especially heavily on people with low incomes, people of color, immigrants, young people, people with disabilities, and those living in rural and other medically underserved areas. Abortion bans and restrictions are compounded further by the ongoing criminalization of people who are pregnant, including those who are incarcerated, living with HIV, or with substance-use disorders. These populations already experience health disparities due to social, political, and environmental inequities, and restrictions on abortion services exacerbate these harms. Removing bans and restrictions on abortion services would constitute one important step on the path toward realizing reproductive justice by ensuring that the full range of reproductive health care is accessible to all who need it. (14) Abortion bans and restrictions are tools of gender oppression, as they target health care services that are used primarily by women. These paternalistic bans and restrictions rely on and reinforce harmful stereotypes about gender roles and women’s decisionmaking, undermining their ability to control their own lives and well-being. These restrictions harm the basic autonomy, dignity, and equality of women. (15) The terms woman and women are used in this bill to reflect the identity of the majority of people targeted and most directly affected by bans and restrictions on abortion services, which are rooted in misogyny. However, access to abortion services is critical to the health of every person capable of becoming pregnant. This Act is intended to protect all people with the capacity for pregnancy—cisgender women, transgender men, nonbinary individuals, those who identify with a different gender, and others—who are unjustly harmed by restrictions on abortion services. (16) Pregnant individuals will continue to experience a range of pregnancy outcomes, including abortion, miscarriage, stillbirths, and infant losses regardless of how the State attempts to exert power over their reproductive decisionmaking, and will continue to need support for their health and well-being through their reproductive lifespans. (17) Evidence from the United States and around the globe bears out that criminalizing abortion invariably leads to arrests, investigations, and imprisonment of people who end their pregnancies or experience pregnancy loss, leading to violations of fundamental rights to liberty, dignity, bodily autonomy, equality, due process, privacy, health, and freedom from cruel and inhumane treatment. (18) All major experts in public health and medicine such as the American Medical Association, American Public Health Association, American Academy of Pediatrics, American Society of Addiction Medicine, and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, oppose the criminalization of pregnancy outcomes because the threat of being subject to investigation or punishment through the criminal legal system when seeking health care threatens pregnant people’s lives and undermines public health by deterring people from seeking care for obstetrical emergencies. (19) Antiabortion stigma that is compounded by abortion bans and restrictions also contributes to violence and harassment that put both people seeking and people providing abortion care at risk. From 1977 to 2021, there were 11 murders, 42 bombings, 196 acts of arson, 491 assaults, and thousands of other incidents of criminal activity directed at abortion seekers, providers, volunteers, and clinic staff. This violence existed under Roe and has been steadily escalating for years. The presence of dangerous protestors and organized extremists acts as yet another barrier to abortion care, and this threat has become even more urgent as abortion bans proliferate and stigma around abortion care increases. (20) Abortion is one of the safest medical procedures in the United States. An independent, comprehensive review of the state of science on the safety and quality of abortion services, published by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine in 2018, found that abortion in the United States is safe and effective and that the biggest threats to the quality of abortion services in the United States are State regulations that create barriers to care. Such abortion-specific restrictions, as well as broader State bans, conflict with medical standards and are not supported by the recommendations and guidelines issued by leading reproductive health care professional organizations including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the Society of Family Planning, the National Abortion Federation, the World Health Organization, and others. (21) For over 20 years, medication abortion care has been available in the United States as a safe, effective, Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved treatment to end an early pregnancy. Today, medication abortion care accounts for more than half of all pregnancy terminations in the United States; however, significant barriers to access remain in place, particularly in States that have imposed onerous restrictions that conflict with FDA’s regulation of medication abortion. Additionally, opponents of abortion are now deploying new tactics to limit access to this FDA-approved medication that would set a dangerous precedent for the Federal regulation of medication products and have national repercussions. (22) Health care providers are subject to licensing laws in various jurisdictions, which are not affected by this Act except as expressly provided in this Act. (23) International human rights law recognizes that access to abortion is intrinsically linked to the rights to life, health, equality and nondiscrimination, privacy, and freedom from ill treatment. United Nations (UN) human rights treaty monitoring bodies have found that legal abortion services, like other reproductive health care services, must be available, accessible, affordable, acceptable, and of good quality. UN human rights treaty bodies have condemned criminalization of abortion and medically unnecessary barriers to abortion services, including mandatory waiting periods, biased counseling requirements, and third-party authorization requirements. (24) Core human rights treaties ratified by the United States protect access to abortion. For example, in 2018, the UN Human Rights Committee, which oversees implementation of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), made clear that the right to life, enshrined in Article 6 of the ICCPR, at a minimum requires governments to provide safe, legal, and effective access to abortion where a person’s life and health are at risk, or when carrying a pregnancy to term would otherwise cause substantial pain or suffering. The Committee stated that governments must not impose restrictions on abortion which subject women and girls to physical or mental pain or suffering, discriminate against them, arbitrarily interfere with their privacy, or place them at risk of undertaking unsafe abortions. The Committee stated that governments should not apply criminal sanctions to women and girls who undergo abortion or to medical service providers who assist them in doing so. Furthermore, the Committee stated that governments should remove existing barriers that deny effective access to safe and legal abortion, refrain from introducing new barriers to abortion, and prevent the stigmatization of those seeking abortion. (25) International human rights experts have condemned the Dobbs decision and regression on abortion rights in the United States more generally as a violation of human rights. Immediately upon release of the decision, then-UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet reiterated human rights protections for abortion and the impact that the decision will have on the fundamental rights of millions within the United States, particularly people with low incomes and people belonging to racial and ethnic minorities. UN independent human rights experts, including the UN Working Group on discrimination against women and girls, the UN Special Rapporteur on the right to health, and the UN Special Rapporteur on violence against women and girls, similarly denounced the decision. At the conclusion of a human rights review of the United States in August 2022, the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination noted deep concerns with the Dobbs decision and recommended that the United States address the disparate impact that it will have on racial and ethnic minorities, Indigenous women, and those with low incomes. (26) Abortion bans and restrictions affect the cost and availability of abortion services, and the settings in which abortion services are delivered. People travel across State lines and otherwise engage in interstate commerce to access this essential medical care. Likewise, health care providers travel across State lines and otherwise engage in interstate commerce in order to provide abortion services to patients, and more would be forced to do so absent this Act. (27) Legal limitations and requirements imposed upon health care providers or their patients invariably affect commerce over which the United States has jurisdiction. Health care providers engage in a form of economic and commercial activity when they provide abortion services, and there is an interstate market for abortion services. (28) Abortion bans and restrictions substantially affect interstate commerce in numerous ways. For example, to provide abortion services, health care providers engage in interstate commerce to purchase medicine, medical equipment, and other necessary goods and services. To provide and assist others in providing abortion services, health care providers engage in interstate commerce to obtain and provide training. To provide abortion services, health care providers employ and obtain commercial services from doctors, nurses, and other personnel who engage in interstate commerce, including by and traveling across State lines. (29) Congress has the authority to enact this Act to protect access to abortion services pursuant to— (A) its powers under the commerce clause of section 8 of article I of the Constitution of the United States; (B) its powers under section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States to enforce the provisions of section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment; and (C) its powers under the necessary and proper clause of section 8 of article I of the Constitution of the United States. (30) Congress has used its authority in the past to protect access to abortion services and health care providers’ ability to provide abortion services. In the early 1990s, protests and blockades at health care facilities where abortion services were provided, and associated violence, increased dramatically and reached crisis level, requiring congressional action. Congress passed the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act ( Public Law 103–259 ; 108 Stat. 694) to address that situation and protect physical access to abortion services. (31) Congressional action is necessary to put an end to harmful restrictions, to protect access to abortion services for everyone regardless of where they live, to protect the ability of health care providers to provide these services in a safe and accessible manner, and to eliminate unwarranted burdens on commerce and the right to travel. 3. Purpose The purposes of this Act are as follows: (1) To permit people to seek and obtain abortion services, and to permit health care providers to provide abortion services, without harmful or unwarranted limitations or requirements that single out the provision of abortion services for restrictions that are more burdensome than those restrictions imposed on medically comparable procedures, do not significantly advance reproductive health or the safety of abortion services, or make abortion services more difficult to access. (2) To promote access to abortion services and thereby protect women’s ability to participate equally in the economic and social life of the United States. (3) To protect people’s ability to make decisions about their bodies, medical care, family, and life’s course. (4) To eliminate unwarranted burdens on commerce and the right to travel. Abortion bans and restrictions invariably affect commerce over which the United States has jurisdiction. Health care providers engage in economic and commercial activity when they provide abortion services. Moreover, there is an interstate market for abortion services and, in order to provide such services, health care providers engage in interstate commerce to purchase medicine, medical equipment, and other necessary goods and services; to obtain and provide training; and to employ and obtain commercial services from health care personnel, many of whom themselves engage in interstate commerce, including by traveling across State lines. Congress has the authority to enact this Act to protect access to abortion services pursuant to— (A) its powers under the commerce clause of section 8 of article I of the Constitution of the United States; (B) its powers under section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States to enforce the provisions of section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment; and (C) its powers under the necessary and proper clause of section 8 of article I of the Constitution of the United States. 4. Definitions In this Act: (1) Abortion services The term abortion services means an abortion and any medical or non-medical services related to and provided in conjunction with an abortion (whether or not provided at the same time or on the same day as the abortion). (2) Government The term government includes each branch, department, agency, instrumentality, and official of the United States or a State. (3) Health care provider The term health care provider means any entity (including any hospital, clinic, or pharmacy) or individual (including any physician, certified nurse-midwife, nurse practitioner, pharmacist, or physician assistant) that— (A) is engaged or seeks to engage in the delivery of health care services, including abortion services; and (B) if required by law or regulation to be licensed or certified to engage in the delivery of such services— (i) is so licensed or certified; or (ii) would be so licensed or certified but for their past, present, or potential provision of abortion services protected by section 4. (4) Medically comparable procedures The term medically comparable procedures means medical procedures that are similar in terms of health and safety risks to the patient, complexity, or the clinical setting that is indicated. (5) Pregnancy The term pregnancy refers to the period of the human reproductive process beginning with the implantation of a fertilized egg. (6) State The term State includes the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and each territory and possession of the United States, and any subdivision of any of the foregoing, including any unit of local government, such as a county, city, town, village, or other general purpose political subdivision of a State. (7) Viability The term viability means the point in a pregnancy at which, in the good-faith medical judgment of the treating health care provider, and based on the particular facts of the case before the health care provider, there is a reasonable likelihood of sustained fetal survival outside the uterus with or without artificial support. 5. Protected activities and services (a) General rules (1) Pre-viability A health care provider has a right under this Act to provide abortion services, and a patient has a corresponding right under this Act to terminate a pregnancy prior to viability without being subject to any of the following limitations or requirements: (A) A prohibition on abortion prior to viability, including a prohibition or restriction on a particular abortion procedure or method, or a prohibition on providing or obtaining such abortions. (B) A limitation on a health care provider’s ability to prescribe or dispense drugs that could be used for reproductive health purposes based on current evidence-based regimens or the provider’s good-faith medical judgment, or a limitation on a patient’s ability to receive or use such drugs, other than a limitation generally applicable to the prescription, dispensing, or distribution of drugs. (C) A limitation on a health care provider’s ability to provide, or a patient’s ability to receive, abortion services via telemedicine, other than a limitation generally applicable to the provision of medically comparable services via telemedicine. (D) A limitation or prohibition on a patient’s ability to receive, or a provider’s ability to provide, abortion services in a State based on the State of residency of the patient, or a prohibition or limitation on the ability of any individual to assist or support a patient seeking abortion. (E) A requirement that a health care provider perform specific tests or medical procedures in connection with the provision of abortion services (including prior to or subsequent to the abortion), unless generally required for the provision of medically comparable procedures. (F) A requirement that a health care provider offer or provide a patient seeking abortion services medically inaccurate information. (G) A limitation or requirement concerning the physical plant, equipment, staffing, or hospital transfer arrangements of facilities where abortion services are provided, or the credentials or hospital privileges or status of personnel at such facilities, that is not imposed on facilities or the personnel of facilities where medically comparable procedures are performed. (H) A requirement that, prior to obtaining an abortion, a patient make one or more medically unnecessary in-person visits to the provider of abortion services or to any individual or entity that does not provide abortion services. (I) A limitation on a health care provider’s ability to provide immediate abortion services when that health care provider believes, based on the good-faith medical judgment of the provider, that delay would pose a risk to the patient’s life or health. (J) A requirement that a patient seeking abortion services at any point or points in time prior to viability disclose the patient’s reason or reasons for seeking abortion services, or a limitation on providing or obtaining abortion services at any point or points in time prior to viability based on any actual, perceived, or potential reason or reasons of the patient for obtaining abortion services, regardless of whether the limitation is based on a health care provider’s actual or constructive knowledge of such reason or reasons. (2) Post-viability (A) In general A health care provider has a right under this Act to provide abortion services and a patient has a corresponding right under this Act to terminate a pregnancy after viability when, in the good-faith medical judgement of the treating health care provider, it is necessary to protect the life or health of the patient. This subparagraph shall not otherwise apply after viability. (B) Additional circumstances A State may provide additional circumstances under which post viability abortions are permitted under this paragraph. (C) Limitation In the case where a termination of a pregnancy after viability, in the good-faith medical judgement of the treating health care provider, is necessary to protect the life or health of the patient, a State shall not impose any of the limitations or requirements described in paragraph (1). (b) Other limitations or requirements The rights described in subsection (a) shall not be limited or otherwise infringed through any other limitation or requirement that— (1) expressly, effectively, implicitly, or as implemented, singles out abortion, the provision of abortion services, individuals who seek abortion services or who provide assistance and support to those seeking abortion services, health care providers who provide abortion services, or facilities in which abortion services are provided; and (2) impedes access to abortion services. (c) Factors for consideration A court may consider the following factors, among others, in determining whether a limitation or requirement impedes access to abortion services for purposes of subsection (b)(2): (1) Whether the limitation or requirement, in a provider’s good-faith medical judgment, interferes with a health care provider’s ability to provide care and render services, or poses a risk to the patient’s health or safety. (2) Whether the limitation or requirement is reasonably likely to delay or deter a patient in accessing abortion services. (3) Whether the limitation or requirement is reasonably likely to directly or indirectly increase the cost of providing abortion services or the cost for obtaining abortion services such as costs associated with travel, childcare, or time off work. (4) Whether the limitation or requirement is reasonably likely to have the effect of necessitating patient travel that would not otherwise have been required, including by making it necessary for a patient to travel out of State to obtain services. (5) Whether the limitation or requirement is reasonably likely to result in a decrease in the availability of abortion services in a given State or geographic region. (6) Whether the limitation or requirement imposes penalties that are not imposed on other health care providers for comparable conduct or failure to act, or that are more severe than penalties imposed on other health care providers for comparable conduct or failure to act. (7) The cumulative impact of the limitation or requirement combined with other limitations or requirements. (d) Exception To defend against a claim that a limitation or requirement violates a health care provider’s or patient’s rights under subsection (b) a party must establish, by clear and convincing evidence, that the limitation or requirement is essential to significantly advance the safety of abortion services or the health of patients and that the safety or health objective cannot be accomplished by a different means that does not interfere with the right protected under subsection (b). 6. Protection of the right to travel A person has a fundamental right under the Constitution of the United States and this Act to travel to a State other than the person’s State of residence, including to obtain reproductive health services such as prenatal, childbirth, fertility, and abortion services, and a person has a right under this Act to assist another person to obtain such services or otherwise exercise the right described in this section. 7.

Short title This Act may be cited as the Stop Antiabortion Disinformation Act or the SAD Act . 2. Findings Congress finds the following: (1) Abortion services are an essential component of reproductive health care. (2) On June 24, 2022, in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, the Supreme Court overruled Roe v. Wade, reversing decades of precedent recognizing a constitutional right to abortion and permitting decimation of an already precarious landscape of access to abortion. (3) The effects were immediate and disastrous. As of January 2023, abortion is unavailable in 14 States, leaving 17.8 million women of reproductive age (ages 15 to 49) and transgender and gender nonconforming individuals without access to abortion in the home State of such individuals. (4) Travel time to an abortion clinic, already burdensome under Roe, has more than tripled since the Dobbs decision, as scores of clinics in already underserved areas have been forced to close and more patients have been forced to travel to other States. As distance to an abortion facility increases, so do the accompanying burdens of time off from work or school, lost wages, transportation costs, lodging, child care costs, and other ancillary costs. (5) The freedom to decide whether and when to have a child is key to the ability of an individual to participate fully in our democracy. (6) Crisis pregnancy centers (CPCs) are antiabortion organizations that present themselves as comprehensive reproductive health care providers with the intent of discouraging pregnant people from having abortions. (7) According to the Journal of Medical Internet Research (JMIR) Public Health and Surveillance, there are more than 2,500 CPCs in the United States, though some antiabortion groups claim that the number is closer to 4,000. (8) According to 2020 data from JMIR Public Health and Surveillance, on average, CPCs outnumber abortion clinics nationwide by an average of 3 to 1. In some States, this statistic is higher. For example, The Alliance: State Advocates for Women’s Rights & Gender Equality (The Alliance) found that in Pennsylvania, CPCs outnumber abortion clinics by 9 to 1. The Alliance also found that in Minnesota, CPCs outnumber abortion clinics by 11 to 1. (9) CPCs routinely engage in a variety of deceptive tactics, including making false claims about reproductive health care and providers, disseminating inaccurate, misleading, and stigmatizing information about the risks of abortion and contraception, and using illegitimate or false citations to imply that deceptive claims are supported by legitimate medical sources. (10) CPCs typically advertise themselves as providers of comprehensive health care. However, most CPCs in the United States do not employ licensed medical personnel or provide referrals for birth control or abortion care. (11) By using these deceptive tactics, CPCs prevent people from accessing reproductive health care and intentionally delay access to time-sensitive abortion services. The harm of these delays is far greater in the wake of the Dobbs decision. (12) CPCs target underresourced neighborhoods and communities of color, including Black, Latino, Indigenous, Asian-American, Pacific Islander, and immigrant communities, by locating their facilities near social services centers and comprehensive reproductive health care providers. CPCs place advertisements in these neighborhoods that mislead and draw people away from nearby providers that offer evidence-based sexual and reproductive health care, including abortion care. This exacerbates existing health barriers and delays access to time-sensitive care. (13) People are entitled to honest, accurate, and timely information when seeking reproductive health care. 3. Prohibition on disinformation of abortion services (a) Conduct prohibited (1) Prohibition It shall be unlawful for any person to engage in deceptive advertising about the reproductive health services offered by the person, including advertising that deceptively states that the person— (A) offers or provides contraception or abortion services (or referrals for such contraception or abortion services); or (B) employs or offers access to licensed medical personnel. (2) Rulemaking The Commission may promulgate regulations under section 553 of title 5, United States Code, to implement this section. (3) Enforcement by the Commission A violation of this section or a regulation promulgated under this section shall be treated as a violation of a regulation under section 18(a)(1)(B) of the Federal Trade Commission Act ( 15 U.S.C. 57a(a)(1)(B) ) regarding unfair or deceptive acts or practices. Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (4) to (6), the Commission shall enforce this section and the regulations promulgated under this section in the same manner, by the same means, and with the same jurisdiction, powers, and duties as though all applicable terms and provisions of the Federal Trade Commission Act were incorporated into and made a part of this section. Any person who violates this section or a regulation promulgated under this section shall be subject to the penalties and entitled to the privileges and immunities provided in the Federal Trade Commission Act ( 15 U.S.C. 41 et seq. ). (4) Nonprofit organizations Notwithstanding section 4, 5(a)(2), or 6 of the Federal Trade Commission Act ( 15 U.S.C. 44 , 45(a)(2), 46) or any jurisdictional limitation of the Commission, the Commission shall also enforce this section or a regulation promulgated under this section, in the same manner provided in paragraphs (1) and (3), with respect to organizations not organized to carry on business for their own profit or that of their members. (5) Civil penalty In addition to any other penalty as may be prescribed by law, any person who violates this section or a regulation promulgated under this section shall be punishable by a civil penalty that shall not exceed the greater of— (A) $100,000; or (B) 50 percent of the revenues earned by the ultimate parent entity of a person during the preceding 12-month period. (6) Independent litigation authority (A) Civil action by Commission If the Commission has reason to believe that a person has violated this section or a regulation promulgated under this section, the Commission may bring a civil action in any appropriate United States district court for any of the following remedies: (i) To enjoin any further such violation by such person. (ii) To enforce compliance with this section or a regulation promulgated under this section. (iii) To obtain a permanent, temporary, or preliminary injunction. (iv) To obtain civil penalties. (v) To obtain damages, restitution, or other compensation on behalf of aggrieved consumers. (vi) To obtain any other appropriate equitable relief. (B) Exclusive authority of Commission Except as otherwise provided in section 16(a)(3) of the Federal Trade Commission Act ( 15 U.S.C. 56(a)(3) ), the Commission shall have exclusive authority to commence or defend, and supervise the litigation of, any civil action under this section and any appeal of such action, in its own name by any of its attorneys, designated by it for such purpose, unless the Commission authorizes the Attorney General to do so. The Commission shall inform the Attorney General of the exercise of such authority, and such exercise shall not preclude the Attorney General from intervening on behalf of the United States in such action and any appeal of such action as may be otherwise provided by law. (b) Reports Beginning 1 year after the date of the enactment of this Act, and every 2 years thereafter, the Commission shall submit to Congress a report that includes, with respect to the previous year, a description of any enforcement action by the Commission under this Act, any regulation promulgated under this Act, and the outcomes of such actions. (c) Savings clause Nothing in this Act may be construed to limit the authority of the Commission under any other provision of law. (d) Definitions In this Act: (1) Abortion services The term abortion services means an abortion or any medical or non-medical services related to or provided in conjunction with an abortion, whether or not provided at the same time or on the same day as the abortion. (2) Commission The term Commission means the Federal Trade Commission. (3) Person The term person has the meaning given that term in section 551(2) of title 5, United States Code. 118 HR 6357 IH: Access to Reproductive Care for Servicemembers Act U.S. House of Representatives 2023-11-09 text/xml EN Pursuant to Title 17 Section 105 of the United States Code, this file is not subject to copyright protection and is in the public domain. I 118th CONGRESS 1st Session H. R. 6357 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES November 9, 2023 Ms. Sherrill (for herself, Ms. Houlahan , Ms. Escobar , Mr. Crow , Mr. Smith of Washington , Mr. Courtney , Mr. Garamendi , Mr. Norcross , Mr. Gallego , Mr. Moulton , Mr. Carbajal , Mr. Khanna , Mr. Keating , Mr. Kim of New Jersey , Ms. Slotkin , Mr. Golden of Maine , Ms. Jacobs , Ms. Strickland , Mr. Ryan , Mr. Jackson of North Carolina , Mr. Vasquez , Mr. Deluzio , Ms. Tokuda , Ms. McClellan , Ms. Sewell , Mr. Horsford , and Mr. Panetta ) introduced the following bill; which was referred to the Committee on Armed Services A BILL To establish leave policies of the Armed Forces for a member to seek an abortion. 1. Short title This Act may be cited as the Access to Reproductive Care for Servicemembers Act . 2. Findings Congress finds the following: (1) Following the Supreme Court’s decision to eliminate the right to abortion, States across the country have moved swiftly to ban abortion access, leading to even greater barriers to care for military families. (2) Access to abortion care is essential to a person’s health and central to their economic and social well-being. Bans and restrictions on abortion delay access to abortion care and therefore increase costs for members of the Armed Forces seeking care. The consequence of these delays and barriers could mean that a person is forced to carry a pregnancy against their will, which can greatly affect their bodily autonomy, financial stability, and overall well-being. (3) The Armed Forces have a large presence in many States poised to ban or restrict access to abortion, many of which also neighbor States that would likely ban abortion. (4) Members of the Armed Forces seeking care off-base may be limited in their ability to do so due to restrictions on leave or travel restrictions imposed by their unit. (5) Restrictions on receiving approval to take leave for abortion care interfere with a member of the Armed Forces’ health, well-being, and right to access the care they need. The decision to terminate a pregnancy should not depend on the discretion or judgment of a military commander. (6) The Secretary of Defense has recognized that abortion is a time sensitive-procedure and access should not be delayed for members or military families. (7) When a member of the Armed Forces decides to obtain an abortion, it should be available, affordable, private, and free from punishment, reprisal, or judgment by the member’s chain of command. (8) Commanders or approval authorities have a duty to display objectivity, compassion, and discretion when addressing all health care matters, including reproductive health care matters, and to enforce existing policies against discrimination and retaliation. (9) The harms of abortion-specific restrictions fall most heavily on people who already face barriers to accessing health care including people with low incomes, such as junior members, and Black, Indigenous, and people of color, immigrants, young people, people with disabilities, the LGBTQI+ community, and those stationed in rural and other medically underserved areas. (10) Equal access to abortion care, everywhere, is essential to social and economic participation, equality, reproductive autonomy, and the right to determine a person’s own life and future. (11) The denial of leave for an abortion or any other reproductive health service violates the rights of members of the Armed Forces. Access to care for military families should not be determined by the personal beliefs of others. (12) In addition to the health and well-being implications for members of the Armed Forces and their families, the failure to address these issues will contribute to the challenges that the Armed Forces faces in attracting and retaining personnel, thereby negatively affecting military strength and readiness. 3. Leave for a member of the Armed Forces for abortion (a) In general The Secretary concerned (as such term is defined in section 101 of title 10, United States Code) shall, with regards to abortion care for a member of the Armed Forces or the dependent of such a member— (1) consider such care to be time-sensitive and therefore approve leave for such abortion care; and (2) not require the member or dependent to disclose to a commanding officer the time-sensitive care or procedure being received during such leave. (b) Reimbursement for travel The Secretary concerned shall reimburse a member or dependent of a member for costs incurred to travel to a clinic that provides abortion care and services if timely access to abortion services is not available near the member or dependent’s location. (c) Privacy Health care providers of the Defense Health Agency and commanding officers shall, to the greatest extent practicable, protect the privacy of a member who takes leave under this section, including when such member makes a request for such leave and when such member returns to duty. (d) Prohibition No member of the Armed Forces may be subject to any adverse action for requesting, taking, or granting leave under this section. 118 HR 4796 IH: Reproductive Health Patient Navigator Act of 2023 U.S. House of Representatives 2023-07-20 text/xml EN Pursuant to Title 17 Section 105 of the United States Code, this file is not subject to copyright protection and is in the public domain.

Short title This Act may be cited as the Reproductive Health Patient Navigator Act of 2023 . 2. Findings Congress finds as follows: (1) As the legal hurdles to abortion services increase, so does the complexity of navigating access to these essential reproductive health services. (2) Community-based organizations like abortion funds are connecting people to abortions, by working with individuals to navigate an ever-evolving landscape of reproductive health care. (3) Abortion funds have been helping individuals navigate the complexity of abortion services for decades and are well placed to lead patient navigation programs. 3. Establishment of grant program for reproductive health patient navigators Subpart V of part D of title III of the Public Health Service Act ( 42 U.S.C. 256 et seq. ) is amended by adding at the end the following: 340A–1. Establishment of grant program for reproductive health patient navigators (a) In general The Secretary shall establish a grant program to support eligible entities for purposes of serving as reproductive health patient navigators for individuals seeking to access abortion services in order to connect those individuals to abortion services. (b) Eligible entities To be eligible to receive a grant under this section, an entity shall— (1) be an abortion fund or other nonprofit organization, a community-based organization, a State, local governmental entity, or Tribal government that, through programs, services, or activities that are unbiased and medically- and factually-accurate, assists individuals seeking abortion services; and (2) submit an application to the Secretary, at such time, in such manner, and containing such information as the Secretary may require, including a plan for— (A) establishing and operating a program of patient navigator services to help individuals seeking abortion services access abortion services, as described in subsection (c); and (B) ensuring that any personally identifiable patient data obtained through the operation of such program is kept confidential. (c) Activities An eligible entity receiving a grant under this section shall use such funds for one or more of the following activities related to abortion services: (1) Offering individuals seeking abortion services medically-accurate, culturally- and linguistically-appropriate services and resources. (2) Coordinating financing resources for travel-related costs, including transportation, childcare, and lodging. (3) Coordinating abortion services, including identifying available abortion providers and scheduling appointments.

I 118th CONGRESS 1st Session H. R. 4268 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES June 21, 2023 Ms. Strickland (for herself, Mrs. Fletcher , Ms. Bush , Mr. Smith of Washington , Mr. Pocan , Mr. Cleaver , Ms. Titus , Mr. Connolly , Ms. Chu , Ms. Crockett , Mr. Panetta , Ms. Kamlager-Dove , Ms. Sánchez , Mr. Casten , Mrs. McClellan , Ms. DelBene , and Mrs. Ramirez ) introduced the following bill; which was referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce A BILL To authorize grants to eligible entities to pay for travel-related expenses and logistical support for individuals with respect to accessing abortion services, and for other purposes. 1. Short title This Act may be cited as the Reproductive Health Travel Fund Act of 2023 . 2. Findings Congress finds as follows: (1) On June 24, 2022, in its decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization (142 S. Ct. 2228 (2022)) (referred to in this section as the Dobbs decision ), the Supreme Court overruled Roe v. Wade (410 U.S. 113 (1973)), eliminating the constitutional right to abortion and reversing decades of precedent recognizing the constitutional right to terminate a pregnancy. (2) While abortion has never been available to all even under Roe v. Wade, the Dobbs decision has decimated access for millions of people in the United States. More than half of States have already banned abortion or are likely to do so. In fact, just 100 days after the Dobbs decision was announced, 66 clinics across 15 States had already been forced to stop offering abortion services. (3) As expected, the implications of the Dobbs decision will fall hardest on people who already face barriers to health care access due to systemic barriers and discrimination, particularly Black people, Indigenous people, and other people of color, people with disabilities, people in rural areas, young people, people with documentation barriers, LGBTQ+ people, people who are parenting, people with complex medical needs who require hospital-based care, and people having difficulty making ends meet. (4) Abortion bans prevent many people from accessing care they want and need. An estimated 10,670 fewer people accessed abortions at clinics in the first 2 months immediately following the Dobbs decision. (5) People have always had abortions and always will, even in the face of legal, financial, and logistical barriers, or criminalization. While some will self-manage their abortions, and have the option of using pills that are medically safe and effective, many others are traveling hundreds of miles out of State, or are forced to carry pregnancies to term. (6) Just months after the Dobbs decision, one-third of women of reproductive age in the United States faced excessive travel times for abortion. For residents of States that had banned abortion, travel times increased by more than 4 hours on average. Black women faced the greatest impact, with 40 percent needing to drive at least 1 hour for abortion care after the decision, versus 15 percent before the decision. (7) Longer travel times lead to a host of other burdens for abortion patients, including the cost of transportation, food, lodging, childcare, and lost wages. (8) Abortion funds and practical support funds (referred to in this section as funds ) are community-based organizations that support people in overcoming financial and logistical barriers to abortion care. (9) Funds work together to remove financial and logistical barriers to abortion access and have been doing this work for decades. Some of these barriers are transportation, food, lodging, childcare, translation, doula services, among other barriers. (10) Many funds are led by people who have had abortions themselves, including a growing base of Black and Brown leaders who have themselves faced abortion obstacles and understand the complex circumstances individuals may face. (11) Abortion funds have a history of being under-resourced and rely mostly on volunteer time and energy to support communities. (12) Abortion and practical support funds hold some of the closest ties to people who are having abortions and have the first-hand experience, up-to-date and on-the-ground knowledge, and the regional and national connections needed to support abortion seekers financially, emotionally, or logistically. (13) More and more States are seeking to ban abortion or enact extreme restrictions, significantly limiting the circumstances in which abortions are available. Furthermore, people have been prevented from seeking care because of the confusion created by abortion restrictions, which has contributed to a chilling effect for people seeking legal care out of State. People seeking abortions often do not have a full understanding of the abortion laws in their State and people calling abortion funds for support often ask if they are doing something illegal by traveling to get care. Abortion funds serve to mitigate this confusion and directly connect people to accurate information. (14) Clinics in States where abortion is legal and more accessible continue to receive an influx of people seeking abortions. Provider shortages, together with this rapid increase in patients, is causing longer waits for appointments, particularly for clinics near States with bans, many of which have had waiting times of more than 3 weeks. (15) When people are not able to access an abortion when they need it, they are often forced to seek an abortion much further into their pregnancy. This increases costs exponentially. Barriers to abortion care after the Dobbs decision have led to an increasing complexity in the cases that abortion funds are managing. People who are forced to cross State lines for abortion care may need support for coordinating and paying for higher logistical barriers (such as transportation, lodging, meals, childcare, medication) to access the abortion care they want, need, and deserve. For many, the increased financial burden will push abortion care completely out of reach without financial and logistical assistance for appointment costs and travel. (16) Funds often collaborate to fully meet the needs of people who are facing barriers to their abortion care, including by filling any remaining funding gaps or referring a caller traveling across regions to another fund. A national network of almost 100 abortion and practical support funds has demonstrated these funds are uniquely positioned to lead at this moment and need support. 3. Grants to pay for travel expenses and logistical support for individuals accessing abortion services (a) In general The Secretary of the Treasury (referred to in this section as the Secretary ) may award grants to eligible entities to pay for travel-related expenses and logistical support for individuals with respect to accessing abortion services.

Short title This Act may be cited as the Health Equity and Access under the Law for Immigrant Families Act of 2023 or the HEAL for Immigrant Families Act of 2023 . 2. Findings; purpose (a) Findings Congress finds as follows: (1) Health insurance coverage reduces harmful racial, economic, gender, and health inequities by alleviating cost barriers to, and increasing utilization of, necessary health care services, especially among low-income and underserved populations. (2) Based solely on their immigration status, many immigrants and their families face legal and policy restrictions on their ability to obtain affordable health insurance coverage through Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and the health insurance exchanges. (3) Lack of health insurance coverage contributes to persistent inequities in the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of health conditions. This leads to negative health outcomes for immigrants and their families, especially Black, Indigenous, Latinx, Asian, Pacific Islander, and other Immigrants of Color. (4) Black immigrant women often cite cost as a major barrier to health care. Many who are undocumented forgo doctor visits altogether due to the financial burden in addition to consistent racial bias by medical practitioners and racism in health care. (5) Nearly half of immigrant women are of reproductive age. Immigrant women, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) immigrants, and immigrants with disabilities disproportionately live in households with low incomes and lack health insurance coverage. Legal and policy barriers to affordable health insurance coverage significantly exacerbate their risk of negative pregnancy-related and other reproductive and sexual health outcomes, with lasting health and economic consequences for immigrant women, LGBTQ immigrants, immigrants with disabilities, and their families and society as a whole. (6) Denying health insurance coverage or imposing waiting periods for health insurance coverage on the basis of immigration status unfairly hinders immigrants’ ability to reach and maintain their optimal levels of health and undermines the economic well-being of their families. (7) Like the Hyde amendment’s prohibition on public insurance coverage for abortion care, immigration-related health care eligibility barriers have long curtailed access to abortion. In June 2022, in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, the Supreme Court of the United States overturned the constitutional right to abortion, exacerbating pre-existing barriers. In the year since the Dobbs decision was issued, 19 States have banned or restricted abortion—disproportionately impacting 15 million women of color and millions of transgender and nonbinary people. Notably, in 2022, 39 percent of all Latinas living in States that were likely to ban abortion following the Dobbs decision were born outside of the United States—this group includes people with varying citizenship statuses, among whom fear of surveillance may be particularly prevalent, due to disproportionate investigation and surveillance that many immigrant communities already face. Bans and restrictions on abortion exacerbate the fear of criminalization in immigrant communities, and contribute to a chilling effect that leads many immigrants to forego reproductive health care and coverage of any kind as they navigate these intersecting risks of criminalization. Polling conducted in 2018 found one in four Latina/o voters (24 percent) had a close family member or friend delay or avoid health care because of fear related to discriminatory immigration policies, and one in five (19 percent) said the same about reproductive health care. (8) Ensuring access to crucial coverage of reproductive and sexual health services such as contraception and pregnancy-related care through Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act is imperative, with only half (52 percent) of immigrants at risk of unintended pregnancy receiving contraceptive care in the previous year. Many immigrants are being denied the basic human right to make the health care decisions they believe are best for them and their families, including abortion care, simply because of their immigration status. In States along the Southern Border, immigrant communities are subject to interior checkpoints that increase the threat of family separation, deportation, and detention, and compound the harm of abortion restrictions that force people to travel to obtain care. Immigrants living without documentation, in particular, may have no way of obtaining an abortion when immigration enforcement and abortion restrictions combine to prevent them from traveling to a provider. Further, due to the high cost of travel associated with the onslaught of abortion bans, practical support organizations that assist with procedure and travel costs have been experiencing high demand, and struggle with inadequate resources. Accessing support services can be out of reach for those without reliable technology to research and maintain contact with support services, or who encounter linguistic barriers when support services are not able to provide translators. For many, abortion care will be entirely inaccessible due to these compounding barriers, thus exacerbating the need for accessible reproductive and sexual health services such as contraception and pregnancy-related and post-pregnancy care. (9) International human rights standards hold that governments have an affirmative obligation to ensure that everyone, including immigrants, can access safe, respectful, culturally and linguistically appropriate, and high-quality pregnancy-related care, including postpartum care, free from discrimination or violence. Medicaid is the Nation’s single largest payer for pregnancy-related care. Nevertheless, barriers to health coverage persist for pregnant and postpartum people, particularly immigrants. (10) Immigrants—especially Black, Indigenous, Latinx, Asian, and Pacific Islander immigrants—are among those most harmed by the United States pregnancy-related morbidity and mortality epidemic, which is the worst among high-income nations. Black people are nearly four times more likely than White people to suffer pregnancy-related death, and twice as likely to suffer maternal morbidity. Indigenous people are two and a half times more likely than White people to die from a pregnancy-related death. The majority of United States pregnancy-related deaths are preventable. Lack of access to health care, immigration status, poverty, and exposure to racism, sexism, and xenophobia in and beyond the health care system contribute to the disproportionately high number of pregnancy-related deaths among BIPOC birthing and postpartum people. Unnecessary barriers that limit pregnant and postpartum immigrants’ access to health care undermine their health, safety, and human rights. (11) One in seven United States residents is foreign-born, approximately one in four children in the United States has at least one immigrant parent, and the population of immigrant families in the United States is expected to continue to grow in the coming years. It is therefore in our collective public health and economic interest to remove legal and policy barriers to affordable health insurance coverage that are based on immigration status. (12) Delaying or denying health insurance coverage because of immigration status can impede mental health and substance use prevention and early intervention interventions. Not acknowledging the impacts of trauma can impact mental health and substance use, and conditions may increase in severity without appropriate and consistent support and treatment. (13) Although individuals granted relief under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program are authorized to live and work in the United States, they have been unfairly excluded from the definitions of lawfully present and lawfully residing for purposes of health insurance coverage provided through the Department of Health and Human Services, including Medicaid, CHIP, and the health insurance exchanges. (14) On April 26, 2023, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) published a proposed rule that would modify the definition of lawfully present used to determine eligibility for Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) health plans and certain other health care programs. Codifying these protections in legislation is crucial to ensure individuals granted relief under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program and those who gain new forms of administrative relief are not similarly excluded in future administrative action. This is even more imperative as more than a quarter of DACA recipients are currently uninsured as they await the finalization of the proposed rule. (15) Since immigration law evolves constantly, new immigration categories for individuals with federally authorized presence in the United States may be created. (16) Some States continue to unwisely restrict Medicaid access for immigrants who have long resided in the United States, fueling significant health inequities and increasing health care costs for individuals and the public. (17) Congress restored Medicaid eligibility for individuals living in the United States under the Compacts of Free Association as part of bipartisan legislation in December 2020 and should build on that success by ensuring all immigrants can access care. (b) Purpose It is the purpose of this Act to— (1) ensure that all individuals who are lawfully present in the United States are eligible for all federally funded health care programs; (2) advance the ability of undocumented individuals to obtain health insurance coverage through the health insurance exchanges established under part II of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Public Law 111–148 ; (3) eliminate the authority for States to restrict Medicaid eligibility for lawful permanent residents; and (4) eliminate other barriers to accessing Medicaid, CHIP, and other medical assistance. 3. Removing barriers to health coverage for lawfully residing individuals (a) Medicaid Section 1903(v)(4) of the Social Security Act ( 42 U.S.C. 1396b(v)(4) ) is amended— (1) by amending subparagraph (A) to read as follows: (A) Notwithstanding sections 401(a), 402(b), 403, and 421 of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, a State shall provide medical assistance under this title, to individuals who are lawfully residing in the United States (including individuals described in paragraph (1), battered individuals described in section 431(c) of such Act, and individuals with an approved or pending application for deferred action or other federally authorized presence), if they otherwise meet the eligibility requirements for medical assistance under the State plan approved under this title (other than the requirement of the receipt of aid or assistance under title IV, supplemental security income benefits under title XVI, or a State supplementary payment). ; (2) by amending subparagraph (B) to read as follows: (B) No debt shall accrue under an affidavit of support against any sponsor of an individual provided medical assistance under subparagraph (A) on the basis of provision of assistance to such individual and the cost of such assistance shall not be considered as an unreimbursed cost. ; and (3) in subparagraph (C)— (A) by striking an election by the State under subparagraph (A) and inserting the application of subparagraph (A) ; (B) by inserting or be lawfully present after lawfully reside ; and (C) by inserting or present after lawfully residing each place it appears.

I 118th CONGRESS 1st Session H. R. 4901 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES July 26, 2023 Ms. Bush (for herself, Ms. Pressley , Mr. Connolly , Mr. Bowman , Mr. McGovern , Mrs. Ramirez , Ms. Velázquez , Ms. Barragán , Ms. Crockett , Ms. Tlaib , Ms. Norton , Ms. McClellan , Mr. Pocan , Ms. Jayapal , Ms. Meng , Ms. Moore of Wisconsin , Ms. Salinas , Mr. Morelle , Ms. Tokuda , Ms. Escobar , Mr. Castro of Texas , Ms. Wilson of Florida , Mr. Tonko , and Mr. Nadler ) introduced the following bill; which was referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce A BILL To amend the Public Health Service Act to improve reproductive health care of individuals with disabilities. 1. Short title This Act may be cited as the Reproductive Health Care Accessibility Act . 2. Findings Congress finds the following: (1) In the United States, approximately 1 in 4 adults have some type of disability, more than 1 in 10 individuals with disabilities can become pregnant, and over 4,100,000 people are parents with disabilities. (2) All people, including individuals with disabilities, have the right to decide if, when, and how to start and raise a family as well as have healthy pregnancies and postpartum periods. (3) Title II and III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 ( 42 U.S.C. 12131 et seq. and 12181 et seq.), section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 ( 29 U.S.C. 794 ), and section 1557 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ( 42 U.S.C. 18116 ) provide individuals with disabilities with the right to equitably access and receive health care. (4) Disabled people face unique barriers when accessing reproductive health care, including accessibility issues at health care facilities, lack of accessible medical diagnostic equipment, barriers to accessible travel, delay in receiving preventative services, and lack of health care providers with training and knowledge on the needs of individuals with disabilities receiving reproductive health care. (5) Reproductive health care is critical to a person’s long-term health. Disabled people have higher mortality rates from reproductive related cancers often due to lack of access to reproductive health care. (6) The United States Access Board has established standards for accessible medical diagnostic equipment; however without enforceable standards adopted by the Department of Health and Human Services and Department of Justice, systemic improvements in the availability of accessible medical diagnostic equipment will not be achieved. (7) Disabled people have an equal right to reproductive autonomy, but harmful stereotypes about people with disabilities create barriers to getting care that respects that autonomy. (8) Laws that restrict access to reproductive health care, including abortion care, disproportionally harm people who already face barriers to reproductive health care, which includes disabled people. (9) Individuals with and without disabilities want children at the same frequency, but individuals with disabilities are less likely to receive contraception counseling and timely prenatal care, experience a higher rate of sterilization, and are at a greater risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes. (10) Diversity and inclusion in the health care workforce is a critical factor in the delivery of high-quality, culturally competent health care and improves patient outcomes. However, the rate of students and trainees with disabilities in medical and allied health education remains low compared to those without disabilities. 3.

Short title This Act may be cited as the Right to Contraception Act . 2. Definitions In this Act: (1) Contraception The term contraception means an action taken to prevent pregnancy, including the use of contraceptives or fertility-awareness-based methods and sterilization procedures. (2) Contraceptive The term contraceptive means any drug, device, or biological product intended for use in the prevention of pregnancy, whether specifically intended to prevent pregnancy or for other health needs, that is approved, cleared, authorized, or licensed under section 505, 510(k), 513(f)(2), 515, or 564 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act ( 21 U.S.C. 355 , 360(k), 360c(f)(2), 360e, 360bbb–3) or section 351 of the Public Health Service Act ( 42 U.S.C. 262 ). (3) Government The term government includes each branch, department, agency, instrumentality, and official of the United States or a State. (4) Health care provider The term health care provider means any entity or individual (including any physician, certified nurse-midwife, nurse, nurse practitioner, physician assistant, and pharmacist) that is licensed or otherwise authorized by a State to provide health care services. (5) State The term State includes each of the 50 States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and each territory and possession of the United States, and any political subdivision of any of the foregoing, including any unit of local government, such as a county, city, town, village, or other general purpose political subdivision of a State. 3. Findings Congress finds the following: (1) The right to contraception is a fundamental right, central to an individual’s privacy, health, well-being, dignity, liberty, equality, and ability to participate in the social and economic life of the Nation. (2) The Supreme Court has repeatedly recognized the constitutional right to contraception. (3) In Griswold v. Connecticut (381 U.S. 479 (1965)), the Supreme Court first recognized the constitutional right for married people to use contraceptives. (4) In Eisenstadt v. Baird (405 U.S. 438 (1972)), the Supreme Court confirmed the constitutional right of all people to legally access contraceptives regardless of marital status. (5) In Carey v. Population Services International (431 U.S. 678 (1977)), the Supreme Court affirmed the constitutional right to contraceptives for minors. (6) The right to contraception has been repeatedly recognized internationally as a human right. The United Nations Population Fund has published several reports outlining family planning as a basic human right that advances women’s health, economic empowerment, and equality. (7) Access to contraceptives is internationally recognized by the World Health Organization as advancing other human rights such as the right to life, liberty, expression, health, work, and education. (8) Contraception is safe, essential health care, and access to contraceptive products and services is central to people’s ability to participate equally in economic and social life in the United States and globally. Contraception allows people to make decisions about their families and their lives. (9) Contraception is key to sexual and reproductive health. Contraception is critical to preventing unintended pregnancy, and many contraceptives are highly effective in preventing and treating a wide array of medical conditions and decrease the risk of certain cancers. (10) Contraception has been associated with improved health outcomes for women, their families, and their communities and reduces rates of maternal and infant mortality and morbidity. (11) The United States has a long history of reproductive coercion, including the childbearing forced upon enslaved women, as well as the forced sterilization of Black women, Puerto Rican women, indigenous women, immigrant women, and disabled women, and reproductive coercion continues to occur. This history also includes the coercive testing of contraceptive pills on women and girls in Puerto Rico. (12) The right to make personal decisions about contraceptive use is important for all Americans, and is especially critical for historically marginalized groups, including Black, indigenous, and other people of color; immigrants; LGBTQ+ people; people with disabilities; people paid low wages; and people living in rural and underserved areas. (13) Many people who are part of the marginalized groups described in paragraph (12) already face barriers, exacerbated by social, political, economic, and environmental inequities, to comprehensive health care, including reproductive health care, that reduce their ability to make decisions about their health, families, and lives. (14) State and Federal policies governing pharmaceutical and insurance policies affect the accessibility of contraceptives and the settings in which contraception services are delivered. (15) People engage in interstate commerce to access contraception services. (16) To provide contraception services, health care providers employ and obtain commercial services from doctors, nurses, and other personnel who engage in interstate commerce and travel across State lines. (17) Congress has the authority to enact this Act to protect access to contraception pursuant to— (A) its powers under the Commerce Clause of section 8 of article I of the Constitution of the United States; (B) its powers under section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States to enforce the provisions of section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment; and (C) its powers under the necessary and proper clause of section 8 of article I of the Constitution of the United States. (18) Congress has used its authority in the past to protect and expand access to contraception information, products, and services. (19) In 1970, Congress established the family planning program under title X of the Public Health Service Act ( 42 U.S.C. 300 et seq. ), the only Federal grant program dedicated to family planning and related services, providing access to information, products, and services for contraception. (20) In 1972, Congress required the Medicaid program to cover family planning services and supplies and the Medicaid program currently accounts for 75 percent of Federal funds spent on family planning. (21) In 2010, Congress enacted the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ( Public Law 111–148 ) (referred to in this section as the ACA ). Among other provisions, the ACA included provisions to expand the affordability and accessibility of contraception by requiring health insurance plans to provide coverage for preventive services with no patient cost-sharing. (22) As of June 2023, at least 4 States tried to ban access to some or all contraceptives by restricting access to public funding for these products and services. Furthermore, Arkansas, Mississippi, Missouri, and Texas have infringed on people’s ability to access their contraceptive care by violating the free choice of provider requirement under the Medicaid program. (23) Providers’ refusals to offer contraceptives and information related to contraception based on their own personal beliefs impede patients from obtaining their preferred method of contraception, with laws in 12 States as of the date of introduction of this Act specifically allowing health care providers to refuse to provide services related to contraception. (24) States have attempted to define abortion expansively so as to include contraceptives in State bans on abortion and have also restricted access to emergency contraception. (25) Justice Thomas, in his concurring opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization (142 S. Ct. 2228 (2022)), stated that the Supreme Court should reconsider all of this Court’s substantive due process precedents, including Griswold, Lawrence, and Obergefell and that the Court has a duty to correct the error established in those precedents by overruling them. (26) In order to further public health and to combat efforts to restrict access to reproductive health care, congressional action is necessary to protect access to contraceptives, contraception, and information related to contraception for everyone, regardless of actual or perceived race, ethnicity, sex (including gender identity and sexual orientation), income, disability, national origin, immigration status, or geography. 4. Purposes The purposes of this Act are— (1) to provide a clear and comprehensive right to contraception; (2) to permit individuals to seek and obtain contraceptives and engage in contraception, and to permit health care providers to facilitate that care; and (3) to protect an individual’s ability to make decisions about their body, medical care, family, and life’s course, and thereby protect the individual’s ability to participate equally in the economic and social life of the United States. 5. Permitted services (a) In general An individual has a statutory right under this Act to obtain contraceptives and to voluntarily engage in contraception, free from coercion, and a health care provider has a corresponding right to provide contraceptives, contraception, and information, referrals, and services related to contraception. (b) Limitations or requirements The statutory rights specified in subsection (a) shall not be limited or otherwise infringed through any limitation or requirement that— (1) expressly, effectively, implicitly, or as-implemented singles out— (A) the provision of contraceptives, contraception, or contraception-related information; (B) health care providers who provide contraceptives, contraception, or contraception-related information; or (C) facilities in which contraceptives, contraception, or contraception-related information is provided; and (2) impedes access to contraceptives, contraception, or contraception-related information. (c) Exception To defend against a claim that a limitation or requirement violates a health care provider’s or individual’s statutory rights under subsection (b), a party must establish, by clear and convincing evidence, that— (1) the limitation or requirement significantly advances access to contraceptives, contraception, and information related to contraception; and (2) access to contraceptives, contraception, and information related to contraception or the health of patients cannot be advanced by a less restrictive alternative measure or action. (d) Rule of construction Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the authority of the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, to approve, clear, authorize, or license contraceptives under section 505, 510(k), 513(f)(2), 515, or 564 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act ( 21 U.S.C. 355 , 360(k), 360c(f)(2), 360e, 360bbb–3) or section 351 of the Public Health Service Act ( 42 U.S.C. 262 ), or for the Federal Government to enforce such approval, clearance, authorization, or licensure. 6. Applicability and preemption (a) General application (1) In general Except as provided in subsection (c), this Act supersedes and applies to the law of the Federal Government and each State, and the implementation of such law, whether statutory, common law, or otherwise, and whether adopted before or after the date of enactment of this Act. (2) Prohibition Neither the Federal Government nor any State may administer, implement, or enforce any law, rule, regulation, standard, or other provision having the force and effect of law in a manner that— (A) prohibits or restricts the sale, provision, or use of any contraceptives as defined in Sec. 2 (2); (B) prohibits or restricts any individual from aiding another individual in voluntarily obtaining or using any contraceptives or contraceptive methods; or (C) exempts any contraceptives or contraceptive methods from any other generally applicable law in a way that would make it more difficult to sell, provide, obtain, or use such contraceptives or contraceptive methods. (3) Relationship with other laws This Act applies notwithstanding any other provision of Federal law, including the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 ( 42 U.S.C. 2000bb et seq. ). (b) Subsequently enacted federal legislation Federal law enacted after the date of enactment of this Act is subject to this Act, unless such law explicitly excludes such application by reference to this Act. (c) Limitations The provisions of this Act shall not supersede or otherwise affect any provision of Federal law relating to coverage under (and shall not be construed as requiring the provision of specific benefits under) group health plans or group or individual health insurance coverage or coverage under a Federal health care program (as defined in section 1128B(f) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1320a–7b(f))), including coverage provided under section 1905(a)(4)(C) of the Social Security Act ( 42 U.S.C. 1396d(a)(4)(C) ) and section 2713 of the Public Health Service Act ( 42 U.S.C. 300gg–13 ). (d) Defense In any cause of action against an individual or entity who is subject to a limitation or requirement that violates this Act, in addition to the remedies specified in section 8, this Act shall also apply to, and may be raised as a defense by, such an individual or entity. (e) Effective date This Act shall take effect immediately upon the date of enactment of this Act. 7. Rules of construction (a) In general In interpreting the provisions of this Act, a court shall liberally construe such provisions to effectuate the purposes described in section 4. (b) Rule of construction Nothing in this Act shall be construed— (1) to authorize any government to interfere with a health care provider’s ability to provide contraceptives or information related to contraception or a patient’s ability to obtain contraceptives or to engage in contraception; or (2) to permit or sanction the conduct of any sterilization procedure without the patient’s voluntary and informed consent. (c) Other individuals considered as government officials Any individual who, by operation of a provision of Federal or State law, is permitted to implement or enforce a limitation or requirement that violates section 5 shall be considered a government official for purposes of this Act. 8. Enforcement (a) Attorney general The Attorney General may commence a civil action on behalf of the United States against any State that violates, or against any government official (including an individual described in section 7(c)) that implements or enforces a limitation or requirement that violates, section 5. The court shall hold unlawful and set aside the limitation or requirement if it is in violation of this Act. (b) Private right of action (1) In general Any individual or entity, including any health care provider or patient, adversely affected by an alleged violation of this Act, may commence a civil action against any State that violates, or against any government official (including an individual described in section 7(c)) that implements or enforces a limitation or requirement that violates, section 5. The court shall hold unlawful and set aside the limitation or requirement if it is in violation of this Act. (2) Health care provider A health care provider may commence an action for relief on its own behalf, on behalf of the provider’s staff, and on behalf of the provider’s patients who are or may be adversely affected by an alleged violation of this Act. (c) Equitable relief In any action under this section, the court may award appropriate equitable relief, including temporary, preliminary, and permanent injunctive relief. (d) Costs In any action under this section, the court shall award costs of litigation, as well as reasonable attorney’s fees, to any prevailing plaintiff. A plaintiff shall not be liable to a defendant for costs or attorney’s fees in any nonfrivolous action under this section. (e) Jurisdiction The district courts of the United States shall have jurisdiction over proceedings under this Act and shall exercise the same without regard to whether the party aggrieved shall have exhausted any administrative or other remedies that may be provided for by law. (f) Abrogation of state immunity Neither a State that enforces or maintains, nor a government official (including an individual described in section 7(c)) who is permitted to implement or enforce any limitation or requirement that violates section 5 shall be immune under the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, the Eleventh Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, or any other source of law, from an action in a Federal or State court of competent jurisdiction challenging that limitation or requirement. 9. Severability If any provision of this Act, or the application of such provision to any individual, entity, government, or circumstance, is held to be unconstitutional, the remainder of this Act, or the application of such provision to all other individuals, entities, governments, or circumstances, shall not be affected thereby. 118 HR 62 IH: Safeguard Healthcare Industry Employees from Litigation and Distress Act U.S. House of Representatives 2023-01-09 text/xml EN Pursuant to Title 17 Section 105 of the United States Code, this file is not subject to copyright protection and is in the public domain.

    "### Analysis of VADER and Top Words \n",
    "\n",
    "The provided sentiment analysis indicates a strongly positive sentiment with a compound score of 1.0 for Democratic Party's congressional bills on abortion. This suggests a highly positive overall sentiment. The use of positive language in these bills, including words like \"health,\" \"care,\" \"program,\" \"provide,\" \"service,\" and \"medical,\" indicates a focus on expanding services to women in need, especially after the overturning of Roe v. Wade and the prevalence of mass Republican bills on abortion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Health and Care:\n",
    "\n",
    "The frequent use of \"health\" and \"care\" suggests a commitment to prioritizing women's health and well-being. It implies an emphasis on comprehensive healthcare services, including reproductive healthcare, to ensure the overall health of women.\n",
    "Program and Service:\n",
    "\n",
    "The inclusion of \"program\" and \"service\" indicates an intention to establish structured programs and services related to reproductive healthcare. This could involve initiatives aimed at providing information, support, and medical services for women facing reproductive health decisions.\n",
    "Provide:\n",
    "\n",
    "The use of \"provide\" underscores a commitment to offering essential resources and assistance. In the context of abortion laws, this term suggests an intent to ensure that women have access to the necessary support and medical care, regardless of the legal landscape.\n",
    "Medical:\n",
    "\n",
    "The repeated mention of \"medical\" highlights a focus on medically sound and safe practices. This term may be associated with efforts to regulate abortion procedures in a way that prioritizes the health and safety of women.\n",
    "Possible Reasons for Positive Sentiment:\n",
    "\n",
    "Response to Restrictive Republican Bills:\n",
    "\n",
    "The positive sentiment could be a response to the perceived restrictiveness of Republican bills. Democratic bills may be positioned as a countermeasure, emphasizing a commitment to providing comprehensive healthcare options for women.\n",
    "Emphasis on Women's Rights and Autonomy:\n",
    "\n",
    "Democratic bills may emphasize women's rights and autonomy over their reproductive choices. Positive language could reflect a commitment to protecting and expanding these rights in the face of legal challenges.\n",
    "Public Health Approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "The use of terms like \"health\" and \"medical\" suggests a public health-oriented approach. Democratic bills may aim to address reproductive healthcare as a public health concern, promoting safe and accessible services.\n",
    "Mitigating Impact of Roe v. Wade Overturn:\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the overturning of Roe v. Wade, Democratic bills may seek to mitigate the potential impact on women's access to abortion services. Positive language could signal efforts to maintain or expand such services despite legal challenges.\n",
    "Inclusivity and Support:\n",
    "\n",
    "Words like \"care\" and \"service\" may indicate an inclusive and supportive approach, suggesting a commitment to providing comprehensive care beyond the abortion procedure itself, encompassing emotional and medical support.\n"

    "### Overall Analysis on Presidential Speeches and Congressional Bills\n",
    "\n",
    "While the VADER sentiment for Presidential speeches for the left and the right showcase a positive sentiment, contrary to predictions, this makes sense in the context of a debate where the candidates are rallying for voters' support. The top words outputted for the Presidential speeches hold more relevance, espcially comparing to the words from the Congressional bills of each party. Words relating to healthcare services and the safety of the mother is seen in both the top words of the Presidential speeches and the Democratic Congressional bills. Conversely, words such as \"unborn\", \"physical\", and \"pregnancy\" are utilized in both the Republican Presidential speeches and the Republican Congressional bills. The VADER sentiment for the Democratic and Republican Congressional Bills is a more accurate representation of the positive sentiment highlighted in the Democratic-issued bills and the negative sentiment highlighted in the Republican-issued bills."

    "Using cosine distances, we measured the similarity between congressional bills, presidential speeches, and articles from the 5 chosen media outlets. In the context of comparing media outlets based on content or editorial perspectives, cosine similarity can capture the degree of similarity in the coverage of various topics or issues. We also chose cosine similarity given its better accuracy and capture of similarity when compared to other methods such as the Euclidean distances. Cosine similarity measures the cosine of the angle between vectors, which is equivalent to measuring the alignment of the vectors in a high-dimensional space. Similar documents will have smaller angles and, thus, higher cosine similarity.\n",

    "For both cosine_distance matrixes between the Presidential speeches and 5 media outlets, there is high variability. The cosine distances range from 0.20 to 1.00, indicating a broad spectrum of similarity or dissimilarity among the Republican speeches and all 5 news outlets. The matrix for Republican speeches and the 5 media outlets, however, show lower variance than the matrix for Demoratic speeches and the 5 media outlets. This perhaps, alludes to the fact that Republican Presidential speeches more align with the word choice in Republican or right-leaning media outlets. This makes sense as many right-leaning media outlets such as FOX news and New York Post is seen quoting from Republican leaders a lot. This is also supported by the lower numbers in the matrix, showin that FOX news and the New York Post have a higher similarity in word features with the Republican Presidential candidates. For the Democratic speeches and the 5 media outlets, there is higher similarity between the Democratic speeches and the media outlets that are more left leaning and centered. This includes the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal, rather than CNN, which showcases more extreme ideology when compared to NYT and the WSJ who are both left-leaning and more centered.\n"

    "There is higher similarity for Democratic Bills and the 5 news media outlets than there is for the Republican bills and the 5 news media outlets. More specifically, the Democratic Bills have a higher similarity with Wall Street Journal and CNN. This is seen in the numbers closer to 0 for the bills selected in the matrix. For the Republican bills, they have a higher similarity with Wall Street Jounral, New York Post, and FOX news. Both of these findings make sense as Congressional bills are supposed to be written using more neutral langauge. Hence, why WSJ (the center media) has high similarity with both Republican and Democratic bills. However, the high similarity scores between outlets that align with their respective ideology and views showcase a relationship between word choice chosen by polticians and news outlets. It is important to know that overall, the Republican bills have a higher dissimialirity with the right-leaning news outlets than the Democratic bills have with the left-leaning news outlets. "

    "High Similarity between CNN and FOX:\n",

    "Despite being perceived as ideologically opposed, CNN and FOX also have a relatively high cosine similarity of 0.77. This could be due to commonality in certain types of news or reporting styles. This makes sense as both slant towards the right political ideology. \n",

    "Dissimilarity between WSJ and NYP:\n",

    "The cosine similarity of 0.5 between WSJ and NYP indicates a lower similarity compared to other pairs. This suggests that these outlets may have more distinct content or editorial approaches. This makes sense as WSJ is more centered and may hold more left-leaning perspectives in articles. \n",

    "General Patterns:\n",

    "The overall pattern in the matrix suggests that CNN and NYT share high similarity with each other and with FOX, while WSJ and NYP are somewhat less similar to the other outlets. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is an interesting find and could showcase that media outlets more towards one side (left or right) utilize less netural language, hence the high similarity between NYT and FOX. More \"radical\" word choice might be used or this could highlight the tendency for the news outlets to mention the other side's news/updates/politicians' speeches.

The American people deserve to know, Quasem Soleimani, the Iranian general, was responsible for the death of hundreds of American servicemembers. When the opportunity came, we saw him headed to Baghdad to kill more Americans, President Trump didn’t hesitate and Quasem Soleimani is gone. But you deserve to know that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris actually criticized the decision to take out Quasem Soleimani. It’s really inexplicable, but with regard to Joe Biden it’s explainable, because history records that Joe Biden actually opposed the raid against Osama bin Laden. It’s absolutely essential that we have a commander in chief who will not hesitate to act to protect American lives and to protect American servicemembers, and that’s what you have in President Donald Trump. Now with regard to the Supreme Court of the United States. Let me say, President Trump and I could not be more enthusiastic about the opportunity to see Judge Amy Coney Barrett become Justice Amy Coney Barrett. She’s a brilliant woman, and she will bring a lifetime of experience and a sizable American family, to the Supreme Court of the United States. And our hope is, in the hearing next week, unlike Justice Kavanaugh received with treatment from you and others. We hope she gets a fair hearing. And we particularly hope that we don’t see the kind of attacks on her Christian faith that we saw before. Democratic Chairman of the Judiciary Committee before, when Judge Barrett was being confirmed for the Court of Appeals, expressed concern that the “dogma of her faith lived loudly in her.” Dick Durbin of Illinois said that it was a concern. Senator, I know one of our judicial nominees, you actually attacked because they were a member of the Catholic Knights of Columbus, just because the Knights of Columbus holds pro-life views.\\n\\xa0My hope is that when the hearing takes place, that Judge Amy Coney Barrett will be respected –\\n\\xa0– treated respectfully and voted and confirmed to the Supreme Court of United States.\\n\\xa0Well, thank you, Susan. Let me just say, addressing your very first question, I couldn’t be more proud to serve as vice president to a President who stands without apology for the sanctity of human life. I’m pro-life. I don’t apologize for it. And this is another one of those cases where there’s such a dramatic contrast. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris support taxpayer funding of abortion, all the way up to the moment of birth, late-term abortion. They want to increase funding to Planned Parenthood of America. Now for our part, I would never presume how Judge Amy Coney Barrett would rule on the Supreme Court of the United States but we’ll continue to stand strong for the right to life. When you speak about the Supreme Court, though, I think the American people really deserve an answer, Senator Harris. Are you and Joe Biden gonna pack the court if Judge Amy Coney Barrett is confirmed? I mean, there have been 29 vacancies on the Supreme Court during presidential election years, from George Washington to Barack Obama. Presidents have nominated in all 29 cases. But your party is actually openly advocating adding seats to the Supreme Court, which has had nine seats for 150 years, if you don’t get your way. This is a classic case of if you can’t win by the rules, you’re going to change the rules. Now you’ve refused to answer the question, Joe Biden has refused to answer the question. I think the American people would really like to know. If Judge Amy Coney Barrett is confirmed to the Supreme Court of the United States, are you and Joe Biden, if somehow you win this election, going to pack the Supreme Court to get your way?\\n But for me, I would tell you that for me the sanctity of life proceeds out of the belief that — that ancient principle that — where God says before you were formed in the womb, I knew you, and so for my first time in public life, I sought to stand with great compassion for the sanctity of life.\\nThe state of Indiana has also sought to make sure that we expand alternatives in health care counseling for women, non-abortion alternatives. I’m also very pleased at the fact we’re well on our way in Indiana to becoming the most pro-adoption state in America. I think if you’re going to be pro-life, you should — you should be pro-adoption.\\nBut what I can’t understand is with Hillary Clinton and now Senator Kaine at her side is to support a practice like partial-birth abortion. I mean, to hold to the view — and I know Senator Kaine, you hold pro-life views personally — but the very idea that a child that is almost born into the world could still have their life taken from them is just anathema to me.\\nAnd I cannot — I can’t conscience about — about a party that supports that. Or that — I know you’ve historically opposed taxpayer funding of abortion. But Hillary Clinton wants to — wants to repeal the longstanding provision in the law where we said we wouldn’t use taxpayer dollars to fund abortion.\\nSo for me, my faith informs my life. I try and spend a little time on my knees every day. But it all for me begins with cherishing the dignity, the worth, the value of every human life.\\n No, it’s really not. Donald Trump and I would never support legislation that punished women who made the heartbreaking choice to end a pregnancy.\\n We just never would.\\n Well, look, it’s — look, he’s not a polished politician like you and Hillary Clinton. And so…\\n You know, things don’t always come out exactly the way he means them.\\n But I’m telling you what the policy of our administration would be.\\n Yeah.\\n I’m telling you…\\n Senator, you’ve whipped out that Mexican thing again. He — look…\\n There are criminal aliens in this country, Tim, who have come into this country illegally who are perpetrating violence and taking American lives.\\n He also said and many of them are good people. You keep leaving that out of your quote. And if you want me to go there, I’ll go there.\\nBut here’s — there is a choice, and it is a choice on life. I couldn’t be more proud to be standing with Donald Trump, who’s standing for the right to life. It’s a principle that — Senator Kaine — and I’m very gentle about this, because I really do respect you — it’s a principle that you embrace.\\nAnd I have appreciated the fact that you’ve supported the Hyde amendment, which bans the use of taxpayer funding for abortion, in the past, but that’s not Hillary Clinton’s view. People need to understand, we can come together as a nation. We can create a culture of life. More and more young people today are embracing life because we know we are — we’re better for it. We can — like Mother Teresa said at that famous national prayer breakfast…', '\\xa0Thank you, Susan. First of all, Joe Biden and I are both people of faith. And it’s insulting to suggest that we would knock anyone for their faith, and in fact, Joe if elected will be only the second practicing Catholic, as President of the United States. On the issue of this nomination – Joe and I are very clear, as are the majority of the American people. We are 27 days before the decision about who will be the next president of the United States. And you know before, when this conversation has come up, you know it’s been about election year or election time. We’re literally in an election. Over 4 million people have voted. People are in the process of voting right now. And so Joe has been very clear, as the American people are: Let the American people fill that seat in the White House, and then we’ll fill that seat on the United States Supreme Court. And to your point, Susan, the issues before us couldn’t be more serious. There’s the issue of choice, and I will always fight for a woman’s right to make a decision about her own body. It should be her decision and not that of Donald Trump, and the Vice President, Michael Pence. But let’s also look at what else is before the court. It’s the Affordable Care Act. Like, literally in the midst of a public health pandemic – when over 210,000 people have died and 7 million people probably have what will be in the future considered a pre-existing condition because you contracted the virus – Donald Trump is in court right now trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. And I’ve said it before and it bears repeating: This means that there will be no more protections, if they win, for people with pre-existing conditions. This means that over 20 million people will lose your coverage. It means that if you’re under the age of 26, you can’t stay on your parents coverage anymore. And here’s the thing. The contrast couldn’t be more clear. They’re trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. Joe Biden is saying let’s expand coverage, let’s give you a choice of a public option or private coverage, let’s bring down premiums, let’s lower Medicare eligibility to 60. That’s true leadership.', ' Elaine, this is a fundamental question, a fundamental question. Hillary and I are both people out of religious backgrounds, from Methodist church experience, which was really formative for her as a public servant.\\nBut we really feel like you should live fully and with enthusiasm the commands of your faith. But it is not the role of the public servant to mandate that for everybody else.\\nSo let’s talk about abortion and choice. Let’s talk about them. We support Roe v. Wade. We support the constitutional right of American women to consult their own conscience, their own supportive partner, their own minister, but then make their own decision about pregnancy. That’s something we trust American women to do that.\\nAnd we don’t think that women should be punished, as Donald Trump said they should, for making the decision to have an abortion.\\nGovernor Pence wants to repeal Roe v. Wade. He said he wants to put it on the ash heap of history. And we have some young people in the audience who weren’t even born when Roe was decided. This is pretty important. Before Roe v. Wade, states could pass criminal laws to do just that, to punish women if they made the choice to terminate a pregnancy.\\nI think you should live your moral values. But the last thing, the very last thing that government should do is have laws that would punish women who make reproductive choices. And that is the fundamental difference between a Clinton-Kaine ticket and a Trump-Pence ticket that wants to punish women who make that choice.\\n Then why did Donald Trump say that?\\n Why did he say that?\\n Well, I would admit that’s not a polished…[crosstalk]\\n Well, can I say…\\n Great line from the — great line from the gospel of Matthew. From the fullness of the heart, the mouth speaks.\\n When Donald Trump says women should be punished or Mexicans are rapists and criminals…\\n … or John McCain is not a hero, he is showing you who he is.\\n Can you defend it?\\n You want to — you want to use a big broad brush against Mexicans on that?', ' Right.\\n Well, if that would happen, because I am pro-life, and I will be appointing pro-life judges, I would think that that will go back to the individual states.\\n If they overturned it, it will go back to the states.\\n Well, if we put another two or perhaps three justices on, that’s really what’s going to be—that will happen. And that’ll happen automatically, in my opinion, because I am putting pro-life justices on the court. I will say this: It will go back to the states, and the states will then make a determination.\\n Well, I think it’s terrible. If you go with what Hillary is saying, in the ninth month, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb of the mother just prior to the birth of the baby.\\nNow, you can say that that’s OK and Hillary can say that that’s OK. But it’s not OK with me, because based on what she’s saying, and based on where she’s going, and where she’s been, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb in the ninth month on the final day. And that’s not acceptable.', ' Well, I strongly support Roe v. Wade, which guarantees a constitutional right to a woman to make the most intimate, most difficult, in many cases, decisions about her health care that one can imagine. And in this case, it’s not only about Roe v. Wade. It is about what’s happening right now in America.\\nSo many states are putting very stringent regulations on women that block them from exercising that choice to the extent that they are defunding Planned Parenthood, which, of course, provides all kinds of cancer screenings and other benefits for women in our country.\\nDonald has said he’s in favor of defunding Planned Parenthood. He even supported shutting the government down to defund Planned Parenthood. I will defend Planned Parenthood. I will defend Roe v. Wade, and I will defend women’s rights to make their own health care decisions.\\n And we have come too far to have that turned back now. And, indeed, he said women should be punished, that there should be some form of punishment for women who obtain abortions. And I could just not be more opposed to that kind of thinking.\\n Because Roe v. Wade very clearly sets out that there can be regulations on abortion so long as the life and the health of the mother are taken into account. And when I voted as a senator, I did not think that that was the case.\\nThe kinds of cases that fall at the end of pregnancy are often the most heartbreaking, painful decisions for families to make. I have met with women who toward the end of their pregnancy get the worst news one could get, that their health is in jeopardy if they continue to carry to term or that something terrible has happened or just been discovered about the pregnancy. I do not think the United States government should be stepping in and making those most personal of decisions. So you can regulate if you are doing so with the life and the health of the mother taken into account.\\n Well, that is not what happens in these cases. And using that kind of scare rhetoric is just terribly unfortunate. You should meet with some of the women that I have met with, women I have known over the course of my life. This is one of the worst possible choices that any woman and her family has to make. And I do not believe the government should be making it.\\nYou know, I’ve had the great honor of traveling across the world on behalf of our country. I’ve been to countries where governments either forced women to have abortions, like they used to do in China, or forced women to bear children, like they used to do in Romania. And I can tell you: The government has no business in the decisions that women make with their families in accordance with their faith, with medical advice. And I will stand up for that right.', ' I don’t see how a person can separate their public life from their private life or from their faith. Our faith informs us in everything we do. My faith informs me about how to take care of the vulnerable, of how to make sure that people have a chance in life.\\n Now, you want to ask basically why I’m pro-life? It’s not simply because of my Catholic faith. That’s a factor, of course. But it’s also because of reason and science.\\nYou know, I think about 10 1/2 years ago, my wife Janna and I went to Mercy Hospital in Janesville where I was born, for our seven week ultrasound for our firstborn child, and we saw that heartbeat. A little baby was in the shape of a bean. And to this day, we have nicknamed our firstborn child Liza, “Bean.” Now I believe that life begins at conception.\\nThat’s why — those are the reasons why I’m pro-life. Now I understand this is a difficult issue, and I respect people who don’t agree with me on this, but the policy of a Romney administration will be to oppose abortions with the exceptions for rape, incest and life of the mother. What troubles me more is how this administration has handled all of these issues. Look at what they’re doing through Obamacare with respect to assaulting the religious liberties of this country. They’re infringing upon our first freedom, the freedom of religion, by infringing on Catholic charities, Catholic churches, Catholic hospitals.\\nOur church should not have to sue our federal government to maintain their religious liberties. And with respect to abortion, the Democratic Party used to say they wanted it to be safe, legal and rare. Now they support it without restriction and with taxpayer funding. Taxpayer funding in Obamacare, taxpayer funding with foreign aid. The vice president himself went to China and said that he sympathized and wouldn’t second guess their one child policy of forced abortions and sterilizations. That to me is pretty extreme.\\n All I’m saying is, if you believe that life begins at conception, that, therefore, doesn’t change the definition of life. That’s a principle. The policy of a Romney administration is to oppose abortion with exceptions for rape, incest and life of the mother.\\nNow, I’ve got to take issue with the Catholic church and religious liberty.\\n … why would they keep — why would they keep suing you? It’s a distinction without a difference.\\n We don’t think that unelected judges should make this decision; that people through their elected representatives in reaching a consensus in society through the democratic process should make this determination.', ' My religion defines who I am, and I’ve been a practicing Catholic my whole life. And has particularly informed my social doctrine. The Catholic social doctrine talks about taking care of those who — who can’t take care of themselves, people who need help. With regard to — with regard to abortion, I accept my church’s position on abortion as a — what we call a (inaudible) doctrine. Life begins at conception in the church’s judgment. I accept it in my personal life.\\nBut I refuse to impose it on equally devout Christians and Muslims and Jews, and I just refuse to impose that on others, unlike my friend here, the — the congressman. I — I do not believe that we have a right to tell other people that — women they can’t control their body. It’s a decision between them and their doctor. In my view and the Supreme Court, I’m not going to interfere with that. With regard to the assault on the Catholic church, let me make it absolutely clear, no religious institution, Catholic or otherwise, including Catholic Social Services, Georgetown Hospital, Mercy Hospital, any hospital, none has to either refer contraception, none has to pay for contraception, none has to be a vehicle to get contraception in any insurance policy they provide. That is a fact.\\nThat is a fact. Now with regard to the way in which the — we differ, my friend says that he — well I guess he accepts Governor Romney’s position now, because in the past he has argued that there was — there’s rape and forcible rape. He’s argued that in the case of rape or incest, it was still — it would be a crime to engage in having an abortion. I just fundamentally disagree with my friend.\\n You have on the issue…\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n The court — the next president will get one or two Supreme Court nominees. That’s how close Roe v. Wade is. Just ask yourself, with Robert Bork being the chief adviser on the court for — for Mr. Romney, who do you think he’s likely to appoint? Do you think he’s likely to appoint someone like Scalia or someone else on the court far right that would outlaw (inaudible) — outlaw abortion? I suspect that would happen.', ' I would consider anyone in their qualifications. I do not believe that someone who has supported Roe v. Wade that would be part of those qualifications. But I certainly would not impose any litmus test.\\n Obviously, that law waived the statute of limitations, which you could have gone back 20 or 30 years. It was a trial lawyer’s dream.\\nLet me talk to you about an important aspect of this issue. We have to change the culture of America. Those of us who are proudly pro-life understand that. And it’s got to be courage and compassion that we show to a young woman who’s facing this terribly difficult decision.\\nSenator Obama, as a member of the Illinois State Senate, voted in the Judiciary Committee against a law that would provide immediate medical attention to a child born of a failed abortion. He voted against that.\\nAnd then, on the floor of the State Senate, as he did 130 times as a state senator, he voted present.\\nThen there was another bill before the Senate Judiciary Committee in the state of Illinois not that long ago, where he voted against a ban on partial-birth abortion, one of the late-term abortion, a really — one of the bad procedures, a terrible. And then, on the floor of the Illinois State Senate, he voted present.\\nI don’t know how you vote “present” on some of that. I don’t know how you align yourself with the extreme aspect of the pro- abortion movement in America. And that’s his record, and that’s a matter of his record.\\nAnd he’ll say it has something to do with Roe v. Wade, about the Illinois State Senate. It was clear-cut votes that Senator Obama voted, I think, in direct contradiction to the feelings and views of mainstream America.\\n Just again…\\n Just again, the example of the eloquence of Senator Obama. He’s health for the mother. You know, that’s been stretched by the pro-abortion movement in America to mean almost anything.\\nThat’s the extreme pro-abortion position, quote, “health.” But, look, Cindy and I are adoptive parents. We know what a treasure and joy it is to have an adopted child in our lives. We’ll do everything we can to improve adoption in this country.', ' Well, I think it’s true that we shouldn’t apply a strict litmus test and the most important thing in any judge is their capacity to provide fairness and justice to the American people.\\nAnd it is true that this is going to be, I think, one of the most consequential decisions of the next president. It is very likely that one of us will be making at least one and probably more than one appointments and Roe versus Wade probably hangs in the balance.\\nNow I would not provide a litmus test. But I am somebody who believes that Roe versus Wade was rightly decided. I think that abortion is a very difficult issue and it is a moral issue and one that I think good people on both sides can disagree on.\\nBut what ultimately I believe is that women in consultation with their families, their doctors, their religious advisers, are in the best position to make this decision. And I think that the Constitution has a right to privacy in it that shouldn’t be subject to state referendum, any more than our First Amendment rights are subject to state referendum, any more than many of the other rights that we have should be subject to popular vote.\\n So this is going to be an important issue. I will look for those judges who have an outstanding judicial record, who have the intellect, and who hopefully have a sense of what real-world folks are going through.\\nI’ll just give you one quick example. Senator McCain and I disagreed recently when the Supreme Court made it more difficult for a woman named Lilly Ledbetter to press her claim for pay discrimination.\\nFor years, she had been getting paid less than a man had been paid for doing the exact same job. And when she brought a suit, saying equal pay for equal work, the judges said, well, you know, it’s taken you too long to bring this lawsuit, even though she didn’t know about it until fairly recently.\\nWe tried to overturn it in the Senate. I supported that effort to provide better guidance to the courts; John McCain opposed it.\\nI think that it’s important for judges to understand that if a woman is out there trying to raise a family, trying to support her family, and is being treated unfairly, then the court has to stand up, if nobody else will. And that’s the kind of judge that I want.\\n Yes, let me respond to this. If it sounds incredible that I would vote to withhold lifesaving treatment from an infant, that’s because it’s not true. The — here are the facts.\\nThere was a bill that was put forward before the Illinois Senate that said you have to provide lifesaving treatment and that would have helped to undermine Roe v. Wade. The fact is that there was already a law on the books in Illinois that required providing lifesaving treatment, which is why not only myself but pro-choice Republicans and Democrats voted against it.\\nAnd the Illinois Medical Society, the organization of doctors in Illinois, voted against it. Their Hippocratic Oath would have required them to provide care, and there was already a law in the books.\\nWith respect to partial-birth abortion, I am completely supportive of a ban on late-term abortions, partial-birth or otherwise, as long as there’s an exception for the mother’s health and life, and this did not contain that exception.\\nAnd I attempted, as many have in the past, of including that so that it is constitutional. And that was rejected, and that’s why I voted present, because I’m willing to support a ban on late-term abortions as long as we have that exception.\\nThe last point I want to make on the issue of abortion. This is an issue that — look, it divides us. And in some ways, it may be difficult to — to reconcile the two views.\\nBut there surely is some common ground when both those who believe in choice and those who are opposed to abortion can come together and say, “We should try to prevent unintended pregnancies by providing appropriate education to our youth, communicating that sexuality is sacred and that they should not be engaged in cavalier activity, and providing options for adoption, and helping single mothers if they want to choose to keep the baby.”\\nThose are all things that we put in the Democratic platform for the first time this year, and I think that’s where we can find some common ground, because nobody’s pro-abortion. I think it’s always a tragic situation.\\n We should try to reduce these circumstances.', ' I would say to that person exactly what I will say to you right now.\\nFirst of all, I cannot tell you how deeply I respect the belief about life and when it begins. I’m a Catholic, raised a Catholic. I was an altar boy. Religion has been a huge part of my life. It helped lead me through a war, leads me today.\\nBut I can’t take what is an article of faith for me and legislate it for someone who doesn’t share that article of faith, whether they be agnostic, atheist, Jew, Protestant, whatever. I can’t do that.\\nBut I can counsel people. I can talk reasonably about life and about responsibility. I can talk to people, as my wife Teresa does, about making other choices, and about abstinence, and about all these other things that we ought to do as a responsible society.\\nBut as a president, I have to represent all the people in the nation. And I have to make that judgment.\\nNow, I believe that you can take that position and not be pro- abortion, but you have to afford people their constitutional rights. And that means being smart about allowing people to be fully educated, to know what their options are in life, and making certain that you don’t deny a poor person the right to be able to have whatever the constitution affords them if they can’t afford it otherwise.\\nThat’s why I think it’s important. That’s why I think it’s important for the United States, for instance, not to have this rigid ideological restriction on helping families around the world to be able to make a smart decision about family planning.\\nYou’ll help prevent AIDS.\\nYou’ll help prevent unwanted children, unwanted pregnancies.\\nYou’ll actually do a better job, I think, of passing on the moral responsibility that is expressed in your question. And I truly respect it.\\n Well, again, the president just said, categorically, my opponent is against this, my opponent is against that. You know, it’s just not that simple. No, I’m not.\\nI’m against the partial-birth abortion, but you’ve got to have an exception for the life of the mother and the health of the mother under the strictest test of bodily injury to the mother.\\nSecondly, with respect to parental notification, I’m not going to require a 16-or 17-year-old kid who’s been raped by her father and who’s pregnant to have to notify her father. So you got to have a judicial intervention. And because they didn’t have a judicial intervention where she could go somewhere and get help, I voted against it. It’s never quite as simple as the president wants you to believe.\\n I respect their views. I completely respect their views. I am a Catholic. And I grew up learning how to respect those views. But I disagree with them, as do many.\\nI believe that I can’t legislate or transfer to another American citizen my article of faith. What is an article of faith for me is not something that I can legislate on somebody who doesn’t share that article of faith.\\nI believe that choice is a woman’s choice. It’s between a woman, God and her doctor. And that’s why I support that.\\nNow, I will not allow somebody to come in and change Roe v. Wade.\\nThe president has never said whether or not he would do that. But we know from the people he’s tried to appoint to the court he wants to.\\nI will not. I will defend the right of Roe v. Wade.\\nNow, with respect to religion, you know, as I said, I grew up a Catholic. I was an altar boy. I know that throughout my life this has made a difference to me.\\nAnd as President Kennedy said when he ran for president, he said, “I’m not running to be a Catholic president. I’m running to be a president who happens to be Catholic. “\\nMy faith affects everything that I do, in truth. There’s a great passage of the Bible that says, “What does it mean, my brother, to say you have faith if there are no deeds? Faith without works is dead. “\\nAnd I think that everything you do in public life has to be guided by your faith, affected by your faith, but without transferring it in any official way to other people.\\nThat’s why I fight against poverty. That’s why I fight to clean up the environment and protect this earth.\\nThat’s why I fight for equality and justice. All of those things come out of that fundamental teaching and belief of faith.\\nBut I know this, that President Kennedy in his inaugural address told all of us that here on Earth, God’s work must truly be our own. And that’s what we have to — I think that’s the test of public service.', ' I’m trying to decipher that.\\nMy answer is, we’re not going to spend taxpayers’ money on abortion.\\nThis is an issue that divides America, but certainly reasonable people can agree on how to reduce abortions in America.\\nI signed the partial-birth — the ban on partial-birth abortion. It’s a brutal practice. It’s one way to help reduce abortions. My opponent voted against the ban.\\nI think there ought to be parental notification laws. He’s against them.\\nI signed a bill called the Unborn Victims of Violence Act.\\nIn other words, if you’re a mom and you’re pregnant and you get killed, the murderer gets tried for two cases, not just one. My opponent was against that.\\nThese are reasonable ways to help promote a culture of life in America. I think it is a worthy goal in America to have every child protected by law and welcomed in life.\\nI also think we ought to continue to have good adoption law as an alternative to abortion.\\nAnd we need to promote maternity group homes, which my administration has done.\\nCulture of life is really important for a country to have if it’s going to be a hospitable society.\\nThank you.\\n Well, it’s pretty simple when they say: Are you for a ban on partial birth abortion? Yes or no?\\n I think it’s important to promote a culture of life. I think a hospitable society is a society where every being counts and every person matters. I believe the ideal world is one in which every child is protected in law and welcomed to life. I understand there’s great differences on this issue of abortion, but I believe reasonable people can come together and put good law in place that will help reduce the number of abortions.\\nTake, for example, the ban on partial birth abortion. It’s a brutal practice. People from both political parties came together in the halls of Congress and voted overwhelmingly to ban that practice. It made a lot of sense. My opponent, in that he’s out of the mainstream, voted against that law.\\nWhat I’m saying is, is that as we promote life and promote a culture of life, surely there are ways we can work together to reduce the number of abortions: continue to promote adoption laws — it’s a great alternative to abortion — continue to fund and promote maternity group homes; I will continue to promote abstinence programs.\\nThe last debate, my opponent said his wife was involved with those programs. That’s great. I appreciate that very much. All of us ought to be involved with programs that provide a viable alternative to abortion.\\n I don’t think a president can do that. I was disappointed in the ruling because I think abortions ought to be more rare in America, and I’m worried that that pill will create more abortions and cause more people to have abortions. This is a very important topic and it’s a very sensitive topic, because a lot of good people disagree on the issue. I think what the next president ought to do is to promote a culture of life in America. Life of the elderly and life of those living all across the country. Life of the unborn. As a matter of fact, I think a noble goal for this country is that every child, born or unborn, need to be protected by law and welcomed to life. I know we need to change a lot of minds before we get there in America. What I do believe is that we can find good, common ground on issues of parental consent or parental notification. I know we need to ban partial birth abortions. This is a place where my opponent and I have strong disagreement. I believe banning partial birth abortions would be a positive step to reducing the number of abortions in America. This is an issue that will require a new attitude. We’ve been battling over abortion for a long period of time. Surely this nation can come together to promote the value of life. Surely we can fight off these laws that will encourage doctors to — to allow doctors to take the lives of our seniors. Surely we can work together to create a cultural life so some of these youngsters who feel like they can take a neighbor’s life with a gun will understand that that’s not the way America is meant to be. Surely we can find common ground to reduce the number of abortions in America. As to the drug itself, I mentioned I was disappointed. I hope the FDA took its time to make sure that American women will be safe who use this drug.', ' Well, Jim, the FDA took 12 years, and I do support that decision. They determined it was medically safe for the women who use that drug. This is indeed a very important issue. First of all on the issue of partial birth or so-called late-term abortion, I would sign a law banning that procedure, provided that doctors have the ability to save a woman’s life or to act if her health is severely at risk. That’s not the main issue. The main issue is whether or not the Roe v. Wade decision is going to be overturned. I support a woman’s right to choose. My opponent does not. It is important because the next president is going to appoint three and maybe even four justices of the Supreme Court. And Governor Bush has declared to the anti-choice groups that he will appoint justices in the mold of Scalia and Clarence Thomas, who are known for being the most vigorous opponents of a woman’s right to choose. Here is the difference. He trusts the government to order a woman to do what it thinks she ought to do. I trust women to make the decisions that affect their lives, their destinies and their bodies. And I think a woman’s right to choose ought to be protected and defended.']\n"

      "Original Prez Debate Document:  Well thank you for the question, but I’ll use a little bit of my time to respond to that very important issue before. The American people deserve to know, Quasem Soleimani, the Iranian general, was responsible for the death of hundreds of American servicemembers. When the opportunity came, we saw him headed to Baghdad to kill more Americans, President Trump didn’t hesitate and Quasem Soleimani is gone. But you deserve to know that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris actually criticized the decision to take out Quasem Soleimani. It’s really inexplicable, but with regard to Joe Biden it’s explainable, because history records that Joe Biden actually opposed the raid against Osama bin Laden. It’s absolutely essential that we have a commander in chief who will not hesitate to act to protect American lives and to protect American servicemembers, and that’s what you have in President Donald Trump. Now with regard to the Supreme Court of the United States. Let me say, President Trump and I could not be more enthusiastic about the opportunity to see Judge Amy Coney Barrett become Justice Amy Coney Barrett. She’s a brilliant woman, and she will bring a lifetime of experience and a sizable American family, to the Supreme Court of the United States. And our hope is, in the hearing next week, unlike Justice Kavanaugh received with treatment from you and others. We hope she gets a fair hearing. And we particularly hope that we don’t see the kind of attacks on her Christian faith that we saw before. Democratic Chairman of the Judiciary Committee before, when Judge Barrett was being confirmed for the Court of Appeals, expressed concern that the “dogma of her faith lived loudly in her.” Dick Durbin of Illinois said that it was a concern. Senator, I know one of our judicial nominees, you actually attacked because they were a member of the Catholic Knights of Columbus, just because the Knights of Columbus holds pro-life views.\n",
      " My hope is that when the hearing takes place, that Judge Amy Coney Barrett will be respected –\n",
      " – treated respectfully and voted and confirmed to the Supreme Court of United States.\n",
      " Well, thank you, Susan. Let me just say, addressing your very first question, I couldn’t be more proud to serve as vice president to a President who stands without apology for the sanctity of human life. I’m pro-life. I don’t apologize for it. And this is another one of those cases where there’s such a dramatic contrast. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris support taxpayer funding of abortion, all the way up to the moment of birth, late-term abortion. They want to increase funding to Planned Parenthood of America. Now for our part, I would never presume how Judge Amy Coney Barrett would rule on the Supreme Court of the United States but we’ll continue to stand strong for the right to life. When you speak about the Supreme Court, though, I think the American people really deserve an answer, Senator Harris. Are you and Joe Biden gonna pack the court if Judge Amy Coney Barrett is confirmed? I mean, there have been 29 vacancies on the Supreme Court during presidential election years, from George Washington to Barack Obama. Presidents have nominated in all 29 cases. But your party is actually openly advocating adding seats to the Supreme Court, which has had nine seats for 150 years, if you don’t get your way. This is a classic case of if you can’t win by the rules, you’re going to change the rules. Now you’ve refused to answer the question, Joe Biden has refused to answer the question. I think the American people would really like to know. If Judge Amy Coney Barrett is confirmed to the Supreme Court of the United States, are you and Joe Biden, if somehow you win this election, going to pack the Supreme Court to get your way?\n",
      " But for me, I would tell you that for me the sanctity of life proceeds out of the belief that — that ancient principle that — where God says before you were formed in the womb, I knew you, and so for my first time in public life, I sought to stand with great compassion for the sanctity of life.\n",
      "The state of Indiana has also sought to make sure that we expand alternatives in health care counseling for women, non-abortion alternatives. I’m also very pleased at the fact we’re well on our way in Indiana to becoming the most pro-adoption state in America. I think if you’re going to be pro-life, you should — you should be pro-adoption.\n",
      "But what I can’t understand is with Hillary Clinton and now Senator Kaine at her side is to support a practice like partial-birth abortion. I mean, to hold to the view — and I know Senator Kaine, you hold pro-life views personally — but the very idea that a child that is almost born into the world could still have their life taken from them is just anathema to me.\n",
      "And I cannot — I can’t conscience about — about a party that supports that. Or that — I know you’ve historically opposed taxpayer funding of abortion. But Hillary Clinton wants to — wants to repeal the longstanding provision in the law where we said we wouldn’t use taxpayer dollars to fund abortion.\n",
      "So for me, my faith informs my life. I try and spend a little time on my knees every day. But it all for me begins with cherishing the dignity, the worth, the value of every human life.\n",
      " No, it’s really not. Donald Trump and I would never support legislation that punished women who made the heartbreaking choice to end a pregnancy.\n",
      " We just never would.\n",
      " Well, look, it’s — look, he’s not a polished politician like you and Hillary Clinton. And so…\n",
      " You know, things don’t always come out exactly the way he means them.\n",
      " But I’m telling you what the policy of our administration would be.\n",
      " Yeah.\n",
      " I’m telling you…\n",
      " Senator, you’ve whipped out that Mexican thing again. He — look…\n",
      " There are criminal aliens in this country, Tim, who have come into this country illegally who are perpetrating violence and taking American lives.\n",
      " He also said and many of them are good people. You keep leaving that out of your quote. And if you want me to go there, I’ll go there.\n",
      "But here’s — there is a choice, and it is a choice on life. I couldn’t be more proud to be standing with Donald Trump, who’s standing for the right to life. It’s a principle that — Senator Kaine — and I’m very gentle about this, because I really do respect you — it’s a principle that you embrace.\n",
      "And I have appreciated the fact that you’ve supported the Hyde amendment, which bans the use of taxpayer funding for abortion, in the past, but that’s not Hillary Clinton’s view. People need to understand, we can come together as a nation. We can create a culture of life. More and more young people today are embracing life because we know we are — we’re better for it. We can — like Mother Teresa said at that famous national prayer breakfast…\n",

      "Selected Random Sample:  I’m trying to decipher that.\n",
      "My answer is, we’re not going to spend taxpayers’ money on abortion.\n",
      "This is an issue that divides America, but certainly reasonable people can agree on how to reduce abortions in America.\n",
      "I signed the partial-birth — the ban on partial-birth abortion. It’s a brutal practice. It’s one way to help reduce abortions. My opponent voted against the ban.\n",
      "I think there ought to be parental notification laws. He’s against them.\n",
      "I signed a bill called the Unborn Victims of Violence Act.\n",
      "In other words, if you’re a mom and you’re pregnant and you get killed, the murderer gets tried for two cases, not just one. My opponent was against that.\n",
      "These are reasonable ways to help promote a culture of life in America. I think it is a worthy goal in America to have every child protected by law and welcomed in life.\n",
      "I also think we ought to continue to have good adoption law as an alternative to abortion.\n",
      "And we need to promote maternity group homes, which my administration has done.\n",
      "Culture of life is really important for a country to have if it’s going to be a hospitable society.\n",
      "Thank you.\n",
      " Well, it’s pretty simple when they say: Are you for a ban on partial birth abortion? Yes or no?\n",
      " I think it’s important to promote a culture of life. I think a hospitable society is a society where every being counts and every person matters. I believe the ideal world is one in which every child is protected in law and welcomed to life. I understand there’s great differences on this issue of abortion, but I believe reasonable people can come together and put good law in place that will help reduce the number of abortions.\n",
      "Take, for example, the ban on partial birth abortion. It’s a brutal practice. People from both political parties came together in the halls of Congress and voted overwhelmingly to ban that practice. It made a lot of sense. My opponent, in that he’s out of the mainstream, voted against that law.\n",
      "What I’m saying is, is that as we promote life and promote a culture of life, surely there are ways we can work together to reduce the number of abortions: continue to promote adoption laws — it’s a great alternative to abortion — continue to fund and promote maternity group homes; I will continue to promote abstinence programs.\n",
      "The last debate, my opponent said his wife was involved with those programs. That’s great. I appreciate that very much. All of us ought to be involved with programs that provide a viable alternative to abortion.\n",
      " I don’t think a president can do that. I was disappointed in the ruling because I think abortions ought to be more rare in America, and I’m worried that that pill will create more abortions and cause more people to have abortions. This is a very important topic and it’s a very sensitive topic, because a lot of good people disagree on the issue. I think what the next president ought to do is to promote a culture of life in America. Life of the elderly and life of those living all across the country. Life of the unborn. As a matter of fact, I think a noble goal for this country is that every child, born or unborn, need to be protected by law and welcomed to life. I know we need to change a lot of minds before we get there in America. What I do believe is that we can find good, common ground on issues of parental consent or parental notification. I know we need to ban partial birth abortions. This is a place where my opponent and I have strong disagreement. I believe banning partial birth abortions would be a positive step to reducing the number of abortions in America. This is an issue that will require a new attitude. We’ve been battling over abortion for a long period of time. Surely this nation can come together to promote the value of life. Surely we can fight off these laws that will encourage doctors to — to allow doctors to take the lives of our seniors. Surely we can work together to create a cultural life so some of these youngsters who feel like they can take a neighbor’s life with a gun will understand that that’s not the way America is meant to be. Surely we can find common ground to reduce the number of abortions in America. As to the drug itself, I mentioned I was disappointed. I hope the FDA took its time to make sure that American women will be safe who use this drug. (Index: 10)\n",
      "Selected Random Sample:  Well, I think it’s true that we shouldn’t apply a strict litmus test and the most important thing in any judge is their capacity to provide fairness and justice to the American people.\n",
      "And it is true that this is going to be, I think, one of the most consequential decisions of the next president. It is very likely that one of us will be making at least one and probably more than one appointments and Roe versus Wade probably hangs in the balance.\n",
      "Now I would not provide a litmus test. But I am somebody who believes that Roe versus Wade was rightly decided. I think that abortion is a very difficult issue and it is a moral issue and one that I think good people on both sides can disagree on.\n",
      "But what ultimately I believe is that women in consultation with their families, their doctors, their religious advisers, are in the best position to make this decision. And I think that the Constitution has a right to privacy in it that shouldn’t be subject to state referendum, any more than our First Amendment rights are subject to state referendum, any more than many of the other rights that we have should be subject to popular vote.\n",
      " So this is going to be an important issue. I will look for those judges who have an outstanding judicial record, who have the intellect, and who hopefully have a sense of what real-world folks are going through.\n",
      "I’ll just give you one quick example. Senator McCain and I disagreed recently when the Supreme Court made it more difficult for a woman named Lilly Ledbetter to press her claim for pay discrimination.\n",
      "For years, she had been getting paid less than a man had been paid for doing the exact same job. And when she brought a suit, saying equal pay for equal work, the judges said, well, you know, it’s taken you too long to bring this lawsuit, even though she didn’t know about it until fairly recently.\n",
      "We tried to overturn it in the Senate. I supported that effort to provide better guidance to the courts; John McCain opposed it.\n",
      "I think that it’s important for judges to understand that if a woman is out there trying to raise a family, trying to support her family, and is being treated unfairly, then the court has to stand up, if nobody else will. And that’s the kind of judge that I want.\n",
      " Yes, let me respond to this. If it sounds incredible that I would vote to withhold lifesaving treatment from an infant, that’s because it’s not true. The — here are the facts.\n",
      "There was a bill that was put forward before the Illinois Senate that said you have to provide lifesaving treatment and that would have helped to undermine Roe v. Wade. The fact is that there was already a law on the books in Illinois that required providing lifesaving treatment, which is why not only myself but pro-choice Republicans and Democrats voted against it.\n",
      "And the Illinois Medical Society, the organization of doctors in Illinois, voted against it. Their Hippocratic Oath would have required them to provide care, and there was already a law in the books.\n",
      "With respect to partial-birth abortion, I am completely supportive of a ban on late-term abortions, partial-birth or otherwise, as long as there’s an exception for the mother’s health and life, and this did not contain that exception.\n",
      "And I attempted, as many have in the past, of including that so that it is constitutional. And that was rejected, and that’s why I voted present, because I’m willing to support a ban on late-term abortions as long as we have that exception.\n",
      "The last point I want to make on the issue of abortion. This is an issue that — look, it divides us. And in some ways, it may be difficult to — to reconcile the two views.\n",
      "But there surely is some common ground when both those who believe in choice and those who are opposed to abortion can come together and say, “We should try to prevent unintended pregnancies by providing appropriate education to our youth, communicating that sexuality is sacred and that they should not be engaged in cavalier activity, and providing options for adoption, and helping single mothers if they want to choose to keep the baby.”\n",
      "Those are all things that we put in the Democratic platform for the first time this year, and I think that’s where we can find some common ground, because nobody’s pro-abortion. I think it’s always a tragic situation.\n",
      " We should try to reduce these circumstances. (Index: 8)\n",
      "Selected Random Sample:  Well, I strongly support Roe v. Wade, which guarantees a constitutional right to a woman to make the most intimate, most difficult, in many cases, decisions about her health care that one can imagine. And in this case, it’s not only about Roe v. Wade. It is about what’s happening right now in America.\n",
      "So many states are putting very stringent regulations on women that block them from exercising that choice to the extent that they are defunding Planned Parenthood, which, of course, provides all kinds of cancer screenings and other benefits for women in our country.\n",
      "Donald has said he’s in favor of defunding Planned Parenthood. He even supported shutting the government down to defund Planned Parenthood. I will defend Planned Parenthood. I will defend Roe v. Wade, and I will defend women’s rights to make their own health care decisions.\n",
      " And we have come too far to have that turned back now. And, indeed, he said women should be punished, that there should be some form of punishment for women who obtain abortions. And I could just not be more opposed to that kind of thinking.\n",
      " Because Roe v. Wade very clearly sets out that there can be regulations on abortion so long as the life and the health of the mother are taken into account. And when I voted as a senator, I did not think that that was the case.\n",
      "The kinds of cases that fall at the end of pregnancy are often the most heartbreaking, painful decisions for families to make. I have met with women who toward the end of their pregnancy get the worst news one could get, that their health is in jeopardy if they continue to carry to term or that something terrible has happened or just been discovered about the pregnancy. I do not think the United States government should be stepping in and making those most personal of decisions. So you can regulate if you are doing so with the life and the health of the mother taken into account.\n",
      " Well, that is not what happens in these cases. And using that kind of scare rhetoric is just terribly unfortunate. You should meet with some of the women that I have met with, women I have known over the course of my life. This is one of the worst possible choices that any woman and her family has to make. And I do not believe the government should be making it.\n",
      "You know, I’ve had the great honor of traveling across the world on behalf of our country. I’ve been to countries where governments either forced women to have abortions, like they used to do in China, or forced women to bear children, like they used to do in Romania. And I can tell you: The government has no business in the decisions that women make with their families in accordance with their faith, with medical advice. And I will stand up for that right.

      "Selected Random Sample:  I don’t see how a person can separate their public life from their private life or from their faith. Our faith informs us in everything we do. My faith informs me about how to take care of the vulnerable, of how to make sure that people have a chance in life.\n",
      " Now, you want to ask basically why I’m pro-life? It’s not simply because of my Catholic faith. That’s a factor, of course. But it’s also because of reason and science.\n",
      "You know, I think about 10 1/2 years ago, my wife Janna and I went to Mercy Hospital in Janesville where I was born, for our seven week ultrasound for our firstborn child, and we saw that heartbeat. A little baby was in the shape of a bean. And to this day, we have nicknamed our firstborn child Liza, “Bean.” Now I believe that life begins at conception.\n",
      "That’s why — those are the reasons why I’m pro-life. Now I understand this is a difficult issue, and I respect people who don’t agree with me on this, but the policy of a Romney administration will be to oppose abortions with the exceptions for rape, incest and life of the mother. What troubles me more is how this administration has handled all of these issues. Look at what they’re doing through Obamacare with respect to assaulting the religious liberties of this country. They’re infringing upon our first freedom, the freedom of religion, by infringing on Catholic charities, Catholic churches, Catholic hospitals.\n",
      "Our church should not have to sue our federal government to maintain their religious liberties. And with respect to abortion, the Democratic Party used to say they wanted it to be safe, legal and rare. Now they support it without restriction and with taxpayer funding. Taxpayer funding in Obamacare, taxpayer funding with foreign aid. The vice president himself went to China and said that he sympathized and wouldn’t second guess their one child policy of forced abortions and sterilizations. That to me is pretty extreme.\n",
      " All I’m saying is, if you believe that life begins at conception, that, therefore, doesn’t change the definition of life. That’s a principle. The policy of a Romney administration is to oppose abortion with exceptions for rape, incest and life of the mother.\n",
      "Now, I’ve got to take issue with the Catholic church and religious liberty.\n",
      " … why would they keep — why would they keep suing you? It’s a distinction without a difference.\n",
      " We don’t think that unelected judges should make this decision; that people through their elected representatives in reaching a consensus in society through the democratic process should make this determination. (Index: 5)\n",
      "Selected Random Sample:  Thank you, Susan. First of all, Joe Biden and I are both people of faith. And it’s insulting to suggest that we would knock anyone for their faith, and in fact, Joe if elected will be only the second practicing Catholic, as President of the United States. On the issue of this nomination – Joe and I are very clear, as are the majority of the American people. We are 27 days before the decision about who will be the next president of the United States. And you know before, when this conversation has come up, you know it’s been about election year or election time. We’re literally in an election. Over 4 million people have voted. People are in the process of voting right now. And so Joe has been very clear, as the American people are: Let the American people fill that seat in the White House, and then we’ll fill that seat on the United States Supreme Court. And to your point, Susan, the issues before us couldn’t be more serious. There’s the issue of choice, and I will always fight for a woman’s right to make a decision about her own body. It should be her decision and not that of Donald Trump, and the Vice President, Michael Pence. But let’s also look at what else is before the court. It’s the Affordable Care Act. Like, literally in the midst of a public health pandemic – when over 210,000 people have died and 7 million people probably have what will be in the future considered a pre-existing condition because you contracted the virus – Donald Trump is in court right now trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. And I’ve said it before and it bears repeating: This means that there will be no more protections, if they win, for people with pre-existing conditions. This means that over 20 million people will lose your coverage. It means that if you’re under the age of 26, you can’t stay on your parents coverage anymore. And here’s the thing. The contrast couldn’t be more clear. They’re trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. Joe Biden is saying let’s expand coverage, let’s give you a choice of a public option or private coverage, let’s bring down premiums, let’s lower Medicare eligibility to 60. That’s true leadership. (Index: 1)\n",
      "Selected Random Sample:  Elaine, this is a fundamental question, a fundamental question. Hillary and I are both people out of religious backgrounds, from Methodist church experience, which was really formative for her as a public servant.\n",
      "But we really feel like you should live fully and with enthusiasm the commands of your faith. But it is not the role of the public servant to mandate that for everybody else.\n",
      "So let’s talk about abortion and choice. Let’s talk about them. We support Roe v. Wade. We support the constitutional right of American women to consult their own conscience, their own supportive partner, their own minister, but then make their own decision about pregnancy. That’s something we trust American women to do that.\n",
      "And we don’t think that women should be punished, as Donald Trump said they should, for making the decision to have an abortion.\n",
      "Governor Pence wants to repeal Roe v. Wade. He said he wants to put it on the ash heap of history. And we have some young people in the audience who weren’t even born when Roe was decided. This is pretty important. Before Roe v. Wade, states could pass criminal laws to do just that, to punish women if they made the choice to terminate a pregnancy.\n",
      "I think you should live your moral values. But the last thing, the very last thing that government should do is have laws that would punish women who make reproductive choices. And that is the fundamental difference between a Clinton-Kaine ticket and a Trump-Pence ticket that wants to punish women who make that choice.\n",
      " Then why did Donald Trump say that?\n",
      " Why did he say that?\n",
      " Well, I would admit that’s not a polished…[crosstalk]\n",
      " Well, can I say…\n",

      "Original Prez Debate Document: CNN  — Abortion today, at least in the United States, is a political, legal and moral powder keg. But for long stretches of history, terminating an unwanted pregnancy, especially in the early stages, was a relatively uncontroversial fact of life, historians say. Egyptian papyrus, Greek plays, Roman coins, the medieval biographies of saints, medical and midwifery manuals, and Victorian newspaper and pamphlets reveal that abortion was more common in premodern times than people might think. This long view of abortion matters, according to Mary Fissell, a professor of the history of medicine at Johns Hopkins University. That’s because assumptions about how abortion was viewed in the past color present-day arguments about abortion rights. Those rights have been severely restricted in many US states since Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court ruling that effectively made abortion legally available, was overturned on June 24, 2022, by the US Supreme Court in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization. Abortion opponents portray the rights granted by Roe v. Wade and legal access to abortion as an historical aberration, according to Fissell, which is not accurate, historians say. “We have to understand that this is much more changeable than we’ve been led to believe. There’s a steady constant of women terminating pregnancies throughout history, but the meanings of that act have changed very significantly over time and will continue to change,” said Fissell, who is working on “Long Before Roe,” a book on the history of abortion that will publish in 2025. “The Dobbs decision was not inevitable, but rather a part of a much longer cycle of restriction versus acceptance,” she said. Earliest references to abortion The first written references to abortion are contained in an ancient Egyptian papyrus written about 3,500 years ago. The Ebers Papyrus, a medical text, suggested around 1550 BC that abortion could be induced using a “plant-fibre tampon coated with a compound that included honey and crushed dates.” In ancient Greek and Rome, references to abortion and botanical substances that induce abortion were common in medical and other texts — although it’s not clear how widely they were used, Fissell said. In 411 BC, Greek playwright Aristophanes in his play Lysistrata described a desirable young woman as “trimmed and spruced with pennyroyal,” a plant thought to induce abortion. Plants and botanical substances can have toxic effects, and there’s no evidence on whether historical methods to induce abortion were effective or not. The search for silphium In ancient Rome, another plant that was thought to end an unwanted pregnancy (among other uses), was so valued it disappeared — the first recorded extinction in world history, according to archaeologist Lisa Briggs, a research fellow at Cranfield University and a visiting researcher at the British Museum. Silphium, also used to flavor food, was traded across the ancient Roman empire. The city state of Cyrene (in modern-day Libya), the only region where the plant grew, based its whole economy on the plant. It appeared on coins and other artifacts unearthed from the region, Briggs said. “Contemporary authors said it was worth its weight in gold and silver. And so it clearly had a value beyond just its tastiness. I suspect that women’s desire to use it as an abortifacient is one of the reasons the price was driven up,” said Briggs, who is searching for archaeological evidence of the plant, which was turned into a resin, in shipwrecks and museum collections. Pliny the Elder, a Roman author and philosopher who was born around 23 AD, described the plant’s ability to expel an unborn fetus along with other medical uses. It’s impossible to know for sure whether the plant would have had the desired effect, but modern-day studies on related Ferula plants and lab rats showed the plants “exhibit anti-fertility properties in rodents,” Briggs wrote in a paper she coauthored last year. Briggs believes demand for the plant among women may have been a key factor, although not the only reason, for its extinction. The plant was resistant to cultivation, Briggs noted, and climate change and a shift in soil characteristics may also have been factors. Abortionists who were saints It’s sometimes assumed that Christianity has always unequivocally condemned abortion but Maeve Callan, a professor and historian of religion at Simpson College in Iowa, said this misrepresents the past. “People act like there’s only one acceptable attitude towards abortion if you’re Catholic, or if you’re Christian more broadly, or even if you’re religious more broadly. And there’s always been a diversity of viewpoints,” said Callan, the author of the book “Sacred Sisters: Gender, Sanctity, and Power in Medieval Ireland.” Her research, along with other scholars, has uncovered four medieval Irish saints who celebrated ending pregnancy among their miracles, according to medieval manuscripts that described saints’ lives. Typically, these miracles include a nun who has breached her vow to chastity and become pregnant but, through the saint’s intervention, the pregnancy miraculously disappears. The most famous was Saint Brigid, a lesser-known patron saint of Ireland than Patrick, and one whose standing was honored with an inaugural public holiday this year. According to a churchman named Cogitosus, who wrote the first biography of Brigid around 650 AD — some 200 years after her birth — she miraculously ended a woman’s unwanted pregnancy, “causing the fetus to disappear without coming to birth and without pain.” Another saint, Ciarán of Saigir, rescued a nun abducted by a king, according to a biography:  “When the man of God returned to the monastery with the girl, she confessed that she was pregnant. Then the man of God, led by the zeal of justice, not wishing the serpent’s seed to quicken, pressed down on her womb with the sign of the cross and forced her womb to be emptied.” Callan is quick to point out that these Irish saints weren’t champions of choice for women when it came to unwanted pregnancy, nor was it likely that these saints actually performed abortions. “The miracles show people’s attitudes toward abortion and in some circumstances it was seen as acceptable, even as a miraculous blessing.” According to Callan, the Old Irish Penitential, a book that details punishments for sins, the penance for abortion depended on the stage of pregnancy, divided into three, like trimesters: In the first, three and a half years of penance; in the second, seven years; in the third, 14 years. But as Callan put it, “pretty much everything was a sin.” The Old Irish Penitential also stipulates that oral sex merits four or five years’ penance the first time, seven years if it is repeated. “It’s not permissive. Abortion is not okay (according to these teachings). It’s just less of a sin.” The idea that life begins at conception becomes dominant in Catholic teachings only about 150 years ago, according to Callan. Previously, Catholic teachings suggested that a fetus becomes a person some weeks if not months later, once it receives a rational soul — known as “ensoulment.” This often gets associated with “quickening,” when the mother feels the fetus move for the first time, generally in the fifth month of pregnancy. It wasn’t until 1588, that Pope Sixtus V officially classified abortion, regardless of the stage of fetal development, as homicide. However, after Sixtus’s death in 1590, Pope Gregory XIV quickly rolled back the dictate, limiting it to ensouled fetuses. Why the long view is important In research for her upcoming book, Fissell said she had uncovered that “what people dislike about abortion changes immensely over time.” In ancient Rome, for example, abortion was only an issue for elite women, who were thought to be covering up adulterous relationships. In the Renaissance, abortion was linked to witchcraft. For most of history, abortion has not been an issue about the fetus, like it is today, but rather about women’s behavior. “This whole innocent unborn life that is the language of the American right today, that’s only (in recent) decades. Sometimes abortion was something people didn’t like because it pointed to illicit sex. Women have always terminated pregnancies, for as far back in the historical record we can see,” said Fissell.  “I think the long view is really important. Things were not always as they are today.”\n",

      "Selected Random Sample: Former President Donald Trump has drawn outrage from pro-life conservatives after he panned a six-week abortion ban championed by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis as “terrible.” (Index: 192)\n",
      "Selected Random Sample: 'This is eugenics in 2023 America,' says Students for Life President Kristan Hawkins A local democratic official in Framingham, Massachusetts is under fire for comments made about babies born with disabilities who need access to special education. FRAMINGHAM, Mass. – A local Democrat official in Massachusetts is facing calls to step down after complaining about the cost of special education for children with disabilities who are not aborted. Michael Hugo, the chair of the Framingham Democratic Committee, made the remarks during a city council meeting when discussing a proclamation about access to abortion and crisis pregnancy centers in the city. He said crisis pregnancy centers could misdiagnose a defect in a baby in the womb, leading to them being born and becoming a strain on a school budget. He issued a public apology after 10 days of backlash from members of his own party and parents of special needs children. \"I saw what Michael had said as a personal attack against my own children,\" said Sheryl Goldstein, the chair of the Framingham Disabilities Commission. \"That my children who had special needs were not worth the expense in the school system.\" Massachusetts Democrat told to resign after abortion remarks leave parents irate In his public apology letter, Hugo called his comments \"offensive and hurtful.\" \"I am writing to offer my most sincere and humble apology to members of the Framingham Democratic Committee, but more especially my fellow members of Framingham's disability family community, for comments that I made at the last City Council meeting which were offensive and hurtful,\" he wrote. He said members of the committee did not \"see or review\" his remarks despite being sent out the night before the meeting. \"Our fear is that if an unqualified sonographer misdiagnoses a heart defect, an organ defect, spina bifida or an encephalopathic defect that becomes a very local issue because our school budget will have to absorb the cost of a child in special education, supplying lots and lots of special services to children, who were born with the defect,\" Hugo said at the Feb. 7 meeting. Laura Green, a disability advocate in Framingham told Fox News that she does not accept his apology. \"I feel that it was generic and lackluster. I feel like after a statement like that is made, you can’t just pretend that it didn't happen or take it back because it's damaging to a community of people,\" she said. \"The disability community is the only minority group that you can become a part of at any time.\" An ultrasound of a five month old unborn baby. Crisis pregnancy centers provide ultrasounds to pregnant women for little to no cost. According to his LinkedIn, Hugo is also the director of policy and government affairs for the Massachusetts Association of Health Boards. Jon Fetherston, a special needs advocate and registered Republican said he was in disbelief when he heard the comments. \"As a parent of an autistic child, I read those comments and go ‘what?’\" he said. \"A peer of mine thinks that I should’ve aborted my child because he was going to be a burden to a school budget?\" Kristan Hawkins, the mother of two children with cystic fibrosis and the president of Students for Life told Fox News she was deeply offended by Hugo’s comments.  \"This is discrimination plain and simple,\" she said. \"I think people who say that the sick cost too much for our society better find the fountain of youth real quick because someday that’s going to be them, it's going to be their family members.\" \"This is eugenics, this is eugenics in 2023 America, this is an argument that sadly we’ve heard before and throughout American history, just regurgitated using a bunch of fancy lingo or support for abortion,\" Hawkins added. Laura Green poses with a down syndrome awareness shirt. Laura Green says her best friend with down syndrome inspired her to be a disability advocate. (Laura Green) In his speech, Hugo said he was \"speaking on behalf of the Framingham Democratic Committee,\" adding that it's their mission to \"work for the common good by promoting racial, ethnic, social, and economic equality for the people of Framingham.\" \"It’s astounding to see such a heartless statement, especially coming from 2023 America where we’re supposed to be this progressive inclusive society that celebrates diversity, come out and say ‘well yeah certain people shouldn’t be born because they're going to cost us too much money,\" Hawkins said. A speaker that came shortly after Hugo at the meeting denounced him and said he went \"off the rails.\" \"I’m a lifetime member of the Democratic Committee, and the person who wanted to represent us went off the rails on a different direction that was never brought before the Democratic Committee,\" said Pat Dunne, a former Framingham School Committee member, according to Framingham Source. \"We’re not talking about eliminating special education students and the like. We’re talking about getting out good information to the people in Framingham. And he’s casting a bit too wide for me and that’s why I did want to say something.\" In a letter sent to city council members several hours before the meeting and obtained by Fox News, Hugo provided a preview of his remarks reported to the Source, asking if the state will \"cover the medical costs for a fetus that had sound medical reason to be terminated.\" He questioned if the state would \"cover the costs of special education for a down syndrome affected child\" and \"pay for the extraordinary medical expense of a child with an atrial septal defect?\" \"How much does Framingham’s Public School Department pay for unreimbursed special needs school transportation, specialized education and durable supplies?\" he asked.  Hugo also claimed crisis pregnancy centers' sonographers would likely misdiagnose defects \"while proclaiming that it is a beautiful child living inside the mother and handing her an ultrasound photo that nobody can figure out without training, some diapers and a couple of ‘onesies’ for her new baby.\"  Hugo said he and others are working to prevent pro-life crisis pregnancy centers from opening up in Framingham. Child with down syndrome is evaluated by a doctor. Michael Hugo, a local democratic official in Framingham, MA questioned the costs of children with down syndrome on his city who are not aborted. Hawkins disputed Hugo’s complaints about crisis pregnancy centers. \"Pregnancy care centers offer such excellent free services that even the abortion-supporting community has taken note,\" she said. \"Preventing young mothers from getting free services is a sign that the abortion mindset has poisoned far too many in our culture.\"  Goldstein added that due to her leadership position with the disabilities commission, she has received many calls and texts from families with special needs children in the community. \"People are quite frankly very upset,\" she said \"They want action.\" Sheryl Goldstein poses with her two daughters. \"I saw what Michael had said as a personal attack against my own children,\" said Sheryl Goldstein, the chair of the Framingham Disabilities Commission. The Framingham Democratic Committee echoed Hugo’s apology in a statement issued last week, claiming his remarks did not reflect the full committee, adding \"we fully disavow and denounce them.\" \"If they disavow and do not support those comments, how do you leave him in charge of your organization?\" Fetherston who has a child with autism asked. \"He has an influential position inside the party and if he even thinks that, much less says it in a public meeting, then he shouldn’t be in a leadership position.\" \"I think he should immediately step down,\" Fetherston added. Hawkins said that while she believes Hugo should be removed, his blunt comments \"hopefully woke up a lot of people to their support of abortion.\" Neither Hugo nor the Framingham Democratic Committee responded to Fox News’ request for comment.

      "Selected Random Sample: The former president suggested that Republicans needed to talk about exceptions to abortion bans but was otherwise vague about how his party should discuss the issue. During an interview this week, the conservative media personality Tudor Dixon said the former president had advised her to “talk differently about abortion” during her campaign for Michigan governor last year. Former President Donald J. Trump acknowledged this week that Republican positions on abortion were hurting the party, but offered few details after claiming he knew how to thread the needle. Mr. Trump’s remarks during an interview with Tudor Dixon, a conservative media personality who unsuccessfully ran for governor of Michigan last year, are one more sign that Republicans are struggling to adjust to a political environment in which abortion is a liability rather than a vote driver for them. After the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June 2022, the ruling created a backlash that has benefited Democrats in elections across the country. In her interview with Mr. Trump on her podcast on Wednesday, Ms. Dixon said that the former president had advised her during her campaign for governor to “talk differently about abortion.” “We could not pivot in time, and it really, you were absolutely right, sir,” Ms. Dixon told Mr. Trump. “Yep, that’s what happened to you,” Mr. Trump replied. “And that’s what happened to a lot of other people and — didn’t happen to me because, you know, there’s a way of talking about it. They’re the radicals. They’re the radicals, and you have to explain it. And I think exceptions are very important. I think you need the exceptions. You and I talked about that.” Ms. Dixon took a hard line on abortion during her campaign, expressing support for a total ban except in life-threatening emergencies. She emphasized that “health of the mother and life of the mother are two different things” — suggesting that she might not support exceptions for women whose health was at risk if their life wasn’t — and said she would not support abortion for a 14-year-old who had been raped. “I’ve talked to those people who were the child of a rape victim and the bond that those two people made, and the fact that out of that tragedy, there was healing through that baby,” she told a local Fox station last year, adding: “Those voices, the babies of rape victims that have come forward, are very powerful. When you hear their story and what the truth is behind that, it’s very hard to not stand up for those people.” Ms. Dixon lost to Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, the Democratic incumbent, by more than 10 percentage points. How, exactly, Mr. Trump wants to approach abortion is not clear. He has been loath to talk about it on the campaign trail at all, saying he would “look at” federal legislation to prohibit abortion after 15 weeks, which many of his 2024 rivals have embraced, but making no definitive commitment. And he has generally avoided venues — such as the first Republican debate, or mainstream news interviews — where he is likely to be asked tough questions about the issue. In his interview with Ms. Dixon, he emphasized exceptions to abortion bans, but candidates who back exceptions have not been spared from the electoral backlash, and voters have broadly supported abortion rights in referendums even in red states. His reference to Democrats as the real “radicals” mirrors language used by other Republican candidates, who often falsely accuse Democrats of supporting abortion “up until the moment of birth,” which is not a practice even in states without gestational limits. More than 93 percent of abortions take place in the first trimester, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and more than 99 percent in the first half. (Index: 228)\n",

      "Selected Random Sample: Since her retirement in 2006, the court has dismantled her key rulings on abortion, affirmative action and campaign finance. Justice Sandra Day O’Connor, third from the right, held the crucial vote in many of the court’s most highly charged cases, and her vision shaped American life for her quarter century on the court. Justice Sandra Day O’Connor, who died Friday at 93, was the sort of figure once familiar in American political and judicial life: a moderate Republican ready to look for compromise and common ground. That led her to vote to uphold abortion rights, affirmative action and campaign finance regulations. Since she retired in 2006, replaced by the far more conservative Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., the Supreme Court has dismantled large parts of her legacy. That is nowhere more apparent than in abortion rights. Justice O’Connor joined the controlling opinion in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, the 1992 decision that, to the surprise of many, reaffirmed the core of the constitutional right to abortion established in 1973 in Roe v. Wade. To overrule Roe “under fire in the absence of the most compelling reason to re-examine a watershed decision,” she wrote in a joint opinion with Justices Anthony M. Kennedy and David H. Souter, “would subvert the court’s legitimacy beyond any serious question.” Last year, the court did overrule Roe, casting aside Justice O’Connor’s concern for precedent and the court’s public standing. In his majority opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, Justice Alito wrote that Roe and Casey had “enflamed debate and deepened division.” Justice O’Connor also wrote the majority opinion in Grutter v. Bollinger, a 2003 decision upholding race-conscious admissions decisions at public universities, suggesting that they would not longer be needed in a quarter-century. In striking down affirmative action programs in higher education in June, the Supreme Court beat her deadline by five years. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., writing for the majority, said the timetable was unrealistic and unprincipled. “The 25-year mark articulated in Grutter, however, reflected only that court’s view that race-based preferences would, by 2028, be unnecessary to ensure a requisite level of racial diversity on college campuses,” he wrote. “That expectation was oversold.” Justice O’Connor was also an author of a key campaign finance opinion, McConnell v. Federal Election Commission in 2003. A few years after Justice Alito replaced her, the Supreme Court, by a 5-to-4 vote in 2010, overruled a central portion of that decision in the Citizens United case. A few days later, at a law school conference, Justice O’Connor reflected on the development. “Gosh,” she said, “I step away for a couple of years and there’s no telling what’s going to happen.” President Ronald Reagan nominated Justice O’Connor in 1981, making good on his campaign trail promise to name the first female Supreme Court justice. At the time she was a judge on a state appeals court, not a typical launchpad to the Supreme Court in the modern era, when it has been dominated by former federal appeals court judges. But her origin story was a reflection of her strengths, drawing on a range of experience largely missing among the current justices. Raised and educated in the West, she served in all three branches of Arizona’s government, including as a government lawyer, majority leader of the State Senate, and a trial judge. Her background informed her decisions, which were sensitive to states’ rights and often deferred to the judgments of the other branches of the federal government. Her rulings could be pragmatic and narrow, and her critics said she engaged in split-the-difference jurisprudence. But some of her commitments were unyielding, said Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the second woman to serve on the Supreme Court. “As often as Justice O’Connor and I have disagreed, because she is truly a Republican from Arizona, we were together in all the gender discrimination cases,” Justice Ginsburg, who died in 2020, told USA Today in 2009. What is beyond question is that she was exceptionally powerful. She held the crucial vote in many of the court’s most polarizing cases, and her vision shaped American life for her quarter century on the court. Political scientists stood in awe at the power she wielded. “On virtually all conceptual and empirical definitions, O’Connor is the court’s center — the median, the key, the critical and the swing justice,” Andrew D. Martin, Kevin M. Quinn and Lee Epstein and two colleagues wrote in a study published in 2005 in The North Carolina Law Review shortly before Justice O’Connor’s retirement. In 2018, in a letter announcing her retreat from public life as she battled dementia, Justice O’Connor called for a renewed commitment to nonpartisan values, one that would require “putting country and the common good above party and self-interest, and holding our key governmental institutions accountable.” At the time, Chief Justice Roberts, who had joined the court just months before Justice O’Connor left it, described her place in history. “She broke down barriers for women in the legal profession to the betterment of that profession and the country as a whole,” he wrote. “She serves as a role model not only for girls and women, but for all those committed to equal justice under law.” On Friday, the chief justice added: “We at the Supreme Court mourn the loss of a beloved colleague, a fiercely independent defender of the rule of law, and an eloquent advocate for civics education. And we celebrate her enduring legacy as a true public servant and patriot.” That legacy is striking and real. But in the less than two decades since Justice O’Connor’s retirement, a central aspect of that legacy — her jurisprudence — has proved vulnerable. A correction was made on Dec. 1, 2023: An earlier version of this article misstated the timing of a statement by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. on Justice Sandra Day O’Connor’s death. The statement was issued Friday, not Monday. (Index: 205)\n",
      "Selected Random Sample: The Dobbs ruling has turned a coalition of liberal, swing and moderate Republican voters into a political force. Even in August in Ohio. A voter at a polling location in the suburbs of Cincinnati, Ohio, on Tuesday. Voters in the state rejected a bid on Tuesday to make it harder to amend the State Constitution. Gov. Mike DeWine of Ohio, a Republican, argued that Tuesday’s vote over how to amend the State Constitution was about protecting the state from a flood of special interest money. Secretary of State Frank LaRose, another Republican, urged voters to protect the “very foundational rules” of their constitution. But Ohio voters clearly didn’t buy it. About three million of them showed up for a vote dominated by the debate over abortion rights — an issue that was not technically on the ballot, but was the undeniable force that transformed what would have normally been a little-noticed election over an arcane legislative proposal into a national event. For decades, a majority of Americans supported some form of legalized abortion. But the Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision overturning Roe v. Wade has shifted the political intensity on the issue, reshaping a once mostly silent coalition of liberal, swing and moderate Republican voters into a political force. It’s a force Democrats are working hard to harness in elections across the country next year, often with ballot measures, and it’s a power Republicans have yet to figure out how to match, or at least manage. “We’ve taken it on the chin since Dobbs,” said Michael Gonidakis, president of Ohio Right to Life in Columbus, Ohio, who helped organize efforts supporting the proposal on Tuesday. “One of the things we learned was to get out in front and get out ahead and don’t wait because you’ll be run over by the train.” Officially, Ohio voters were being asked whether to make it harder to amend the State Constitution by raising the threshold to enact a new constitutional amendment from a simple majority to 60 percent and increase the requirements to get such initiatives on the ballot. In remarks before party activists and in strategy memos, Republican officials acknowledged that the measure was an attempt to make it harder for abortion rights supporters to pass a ballot measure scheduled for November that would add an amendment protecting abortion rights to the State Constitution. Those private comments fueled a firestorm of national media coverage, nearly $20 million in political spending and surprisingly high turnout for an election in the dead of summer. More on Abortion Issues in America Texas Lawsuit: A pregnant Texas woman whose fetus has a fatal condition sued the state seeking an emergency court order to allow her doctor to perform an abortion, despite the state’s strict bans on the procedure. On the Ballot: After voters in Ohio approved a measure to enshrine abortion rights in the State Constitution, could Florida be next? Crossing the Border: American women are traveling to Mexico for abortions, crystallizing the shifting policies of two nations that once held vastly different positions on the procedure. A Key Court Ruling: Georgia’s Supreme Court upheld the state’s six-week abortion ban, rejecting arguments that the law was unconstitutional when the state legislature approved it in 2019. Nearly twice as many people voted on the Ohio measure than cast ballots in primaries for governor, Senate, House and other marquee statewide races last year. The power of abortion to mobilize a majority coalition has armed Democrats with a potent new political tool, particularly in crucial battlegrounds like Michigan, Ohio and Arizona where Republican legislatures moved quickly to restrict abortion rights. Already, Democrats are looking ahead to 2024, with activists in around 10 states considering efforts to put abortion protections in state constitutions. If they succeed, those efforts could help boost Democratic turnout in key states — including Arizona, both a presidential battleground and home to a key Senate race next year, and Florida, a traditional swing state that has slipped away from the party in recent elections. The Ohio defeat was powered by a strong showing from Democratic and swing voters. Opponents overperformed in some critical suburban battleground counties. In Athens, for example, a Democratic bastion and the home of Ohio University, voters opposed the measure by 71 percent. Last fall, former Representative Tim Ryan, the Democratic candidate who lost a Senate race to J.D. Vance, a Republican, won the county by 61 percent. Why is this story labeled ‘News Analysis’? In this format, reporters with deep experience in the subject draw on their expertise to help you better understand an event. They step back from the breaking news to evaluate its significance and possible ramifications, but they may not inject their personal opinions. But there were also signs that moderate, and even some conservative voters, were against the idea. In November, 66 percent of voters in Defiance County, a conservative area in the northwest corner of the state, backed Mr. Vance. Only 61 percent supported the proposal to amend the state constitution. “We’ve never seen this amount of spending or attention on an issue related to ballot measure processes and I can tell you it’s not because everyone inherently cares about what the rules are on ballot issues,” said Kelly Hall, executive director of the Fairness Project, which has helped run nearly three dozen ballot measures. “The attention from both sides can only be attributed to the implications for the abortion issue.” A man in a white No. 9 Bengals jersey holds a sign urging people to vote no on the referendum. Andy Brown, 31, stood outside for hours waving to voters in Cincinnati, Ohio, on Tuesday. “It’s a crucial election — a lot is on the line this year,” he said. After spending nearly a half century pushing against Roe, Republicans have struggled to adapt, trapped between a party base that still largely opposes abortion rights and a country that broadly supports them. Abortion played a significant role in motivating key parts of the Democratic base to the polls during the midterm elections. Abortion-related initiatives won in all six states where they appeared on the ballot in 2022 and likely helped to boost turnout for the Democratic ticket in those places. In red and purple states — Michigan, Kentucky and Kansas — the vote for abortion rights was between 52 percent and 59 percent — just below the 60 percent threshold Ohio Republicans were trying to set. This year, Democrats prevailed in a contest for the Wisconsin Supreme Court where their candidate focused on her support for abortion rights in a state with a law banning the procedure. Abortion is legal in Ohio until 22 weeks of pregnancy. After the Supreme Court decision, a law banning abortion at six weeks took effect but was blocked by a state judge while litigation proceeded — which it still is. With Tuesday’s referendum, Republican lawmakers attempted a version of the kind of two-track strategy their party had done successfully for years. To conservative voters, they emphasized the measure’s role in raising the bar for the abortion amendment while, to other audiences, they talked about other potential impacts. For Republicans, the challenge is that most of their voters are out-of-step with the broader electorate. Polling conducted last month by The New York Times/Siena College found that 61 percent of voters believe abortion should be all or mostly legal, a view shared by majorities in every region of the country, across all income levels, ages, racial groups and of both men and women. But 57 percent of Republicans believe the procedure should be all or mostly illegal. On the presidential primary campaign trail, Republican candidates have largely tried to avoid spending too much time on the specifics of the issue. Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida signed legislation prohibiting most abortions after six weeks in his home state, but has stopped short of embracing a federal ban. Others, including Senator Tim Scott, back a 15-week federal ban. And former President Donald J. Trump, who takes credit for appointing three of the Supreme Court Justices who voted to overturn Roe, has not endorsed any kind of restrictions. He’s expressed concerns that moving too far to the right on abortion could cost Republicans votes, saying it could make it “very, very hard to win an election.” But Republicans are unlikely to evade the topic in the general election. In a post-Roe world, where protecting abortion rights has become a priority for a larger swath of voters, the old strategies don’t work quite as well. Katie Paris, the founder of Red, Wine and Blue, a group that organizes suburban women voters for Ohio Democrats, said she saw voters who wouldn’t normally have tuned into a summer election on an obscure political process get engaged. Abortion, she said, snaps them to attention. “There’s constant evidence of how personal this is,” she said. “It’s the perfect case study.” (Index: 223)\n",

    "When clustering the 5 media outlet articles into 2 clusters and outputng the random sample, these are the following findings. \n",
    "\n",
    "Cluster 0 appears to be focused on political speeches and discussions related to abortion, with a prominent mention of former President George W. Bush and his stance on abortion. The texts emphasize the importance of promoting a \"culture of life,\" reducing the number of abortions through various measures, and the controversy surrounding the issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cluster 1 revolves around different news articles discussing abortion-related events. One article talks about former President Donald Trump's views on abortion and the Republican Party's struggle to navigate the issue. Another article discusses the impact of the Supreme Court's decision on abortion rights, specifically mentioning the overturning of Roe v. Wade.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarities:\n",
    "\n",
    "Both clusters involve discussions about abortion as a significant political and social issue. Political figures, including former President George W. Bush and former President Donald Trump, are mentioned in both clusters. Both clusters touch upon legislative actions and court decisions related to abortion, reflecting the ongoing debate and changes in abortion-related policies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cluster 0 primarily consists of speeches or statements made by political figures, while Cluster 1 comprises news articles reporting on various events related to abortion. Cluster 0 is centered around George W. Bush's views and speeches, while Cluster 1 encompasses a broader range of topics, including Trump's advice to a Michigan governor candidate, the Supreme Court's decisions, and events in Ohio.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall: Contrary to predictions, the clusters did not cluster articles into \"right\" or \"left.\" Rather, it clustered articles into more content-based on individual stories surrounding abortion and legislative or polticial news. This showcases that different outlets utilize different methods when getting their story across. After a deeper analysis of the clusters. It is seen that CNN and FOX both utilize a lot of individual narratives focusing on stories on individuals impacted by abortion in their articles. Whereas, New York Times and Wall Street Journal have less subjective stories and a more report of the current legislation or political news or court updates regarding abortion. "

      "Selected Random Sample: Researchers say requests for mail-order medication have surged in the months since the Supreme Court eliminated constitutional protections for abortion (Index: 131)\n",
      "Selected Random Sample: CNN  —  The Supreme Court’s landmark decision allowing states to ban abortion raises new questions about how authorities will enforce such bans and whether the anti-abortion movement will stick to its public emphasis on protecting abortion seekers themselves from prosecution. What has been the pattern abroad in countries that ban abortion, along with United States’ own experience before Roe, previews a complicated and unequal enforcement landscape. For years as they fought to overturn Roe v. Wade, leaders of the anti-abortion movement have stressed that prosecutions should be focused on abortion providers and others who facilitate the procedure, rather than the person seeking it. But the movement’s critics point to examples of when the criminal justice system has already – with Roe still on the books – been turned on women whose pregnancies have been purposely or inadvertently terminated. In one 2018 case, for instance, a Mississippi woman who experienced a stillbirth was accused of second degree murder after authorities obtained her phone data and found she had searched for abortion pills. (The case was later dropped after prosecutors took a closer look at the evidence, including the use of a scientifically questionable test to supposedly determine whether the fetus had been born alive.) One major challenge abortion foes will be facing if Roe falls is the growing use of medication abortion, which allows for women to manage their own abortions in two-pill regimen without the help of the kind of physician that would conventionally be prosecuted under an abortion ban. Because pregnancies that end in a natural miscarriage are often indistinguishable from those terminated with a pill, it’s possible that women’s private data and the information they share with their medical staff will be weaponized by prosecutors. Even if the woman herself is not criminally liable, she may still be dragged through the law enforcement process as part of prosecutors’ efforts to investigate whether her pregnancy was illegally terminated. “What I found in my research is that women were indeed punished, even if, you know, almost none of them are prosecuted and incarcerated for having an abortion,” said Leslie Reagan, a history professor at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and author of “When Abortion Was a Crime.” “That is through the methods of enforcement: interrogating women who were seeking emergency services after having an abortion or trying to induce their own.” How suspicions of abortions could be investigated Whether to bring a case under a state abortion restriction will be a decision ultimately for the local prosecutor, and the promise of some district attorneys in Democratic-leaning localities to not prosecute abortion crimes has prompted red states to explore other mechanisms to carry out bans. But in places where law enforcement officials seek to enforce abortion prohibitions, medical staff who provide treatment to women whose pregnancies have ended could also end up being a source of information for law enforcement officers. In El Salvador, a country with an extremely aggressive approach to carrying out its ban on abortion, government officials are dispatched to hospitals to stress to medical staff their obligation to report suspicions that a patient has intentionally ended her pregnancy, according to Michelle Oberman, a Santa Clara University School of Law professor and author of “Her Body, Our Laws: On the Frontlines of the Abortion War from El Salvador to Oklahoma.” Doctors are told that “if they don’t report those women, they themselves can be subject to fines and other penalties,” Oberman said. In the United States’ pre-Roe era, women who sought medical care after abortions faced interrogations, Reagan said, including threats that “we won’t provide medical, the medical care that you urgently, urgently need” unless they cooperated with the investigations. Even now, medical care that women receive for pregnancies that have been ended can lead to law enforcement getting involved, according to Dana Sussman, the acting executive director of National Advocates for Pregnant Women. Sussman’s organization provides defense attorneys and other resources for people facing charges or investigations related to pregnancy and its outcomes. The organization has documented 1,700 arrests, prosecutions, detentions, or forced medical interventions between 1973 and 2020 on women related to pregnancy or pregnancy outcomes, though the majority of those cases don’t involve a pregnancy loss or abortion. If Roe is reversed, Sussman said, “I think that there will potentially be a lot more collaboration between health care providers and the police.” The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act – a 1996 law also known as HIPAA that sets privacy standards for protecting patients’ personal medical information – has exceptions for law enforcement purposes, Sussman noted. “As we expand the ways in which criminal law applies in these contexts, the HIPAA protections are going to be more limited.” Another common tactic the organization has seen in its work is law enforcement using women’s personal data to find evidence. “When you do have someone who presents with a pregnancy loss and the police or prosecutors are trying to build a case that there was a self-managed abortion,” Sussman told CNN, “what they will look at is one’s digital footprint … who they communicated with and when and about what, what they searched, for purchases they made, credit card bills.” She predicted that this sort of digital evidence “will be the thing that prosecutors will need in order to make that distinction, if they are going to try to distinguish between a miscarriage and a self-managed abortion.” In the Mississippi case, investigators secured a warrant to search the phone of Latice Fisher, a Black woman who had experienced a stillbirth at her home in 2017. To bring the charges, they pointed to data showing she had searched for abortion pills earlier in her pregnancy (there is no way to medically test whether medication abortion drugs are in woman’s system after a miscarriage or stillbirth, since the drugs are usually metabolized more quickly than the time it takes for the fetus to expel). To build the case against Fisher, investigators also relied on a test known as the “lung float test,” a controversial method for investigating allegations of infanticide that dates back to the 17th century and that has been discredited by many medical experts. Fisher’s lawyers pushed back on the use of the “float test.” After prosecutors reviewed the questions about the reliability of that method, as well as other allegations about Fisher that they found to be uncorroborated, they dropped the original indictment. When they represented the case to the grand jury with more context around the evidence, the grand jury declined to bring new charges against Fisher. Laurie Bertram Roberts, the co-founder Mississippi Reproductive Freedom Fund who assisted with Fisher’s defense, equated investigators use of Fisher’s internet search to a “thought crime.” “Let’s say at two months, I’m thinking about having an abortion and I search for stuff. And then I decide not to, and then I have a miscarriage at four and a half months,” Roberts told CNN. “That’s the risk, right? Lots of people think about having an abortion and then don’t.” Who will get targeted with prosecutions Legal and historical experts on abortion bans also expect that the bulk of enforcement will fall on marginalized communities that already face the brunt of policing – with some comparing it to the War on Drugs. “The likelihood of being caught up in this police web is going to be higher for people of color and for lower income people,” Reagan said. Oberman said that in her research of El Salvador’s extremely robust enforcement approach, there were still only around 10 convictions a year, in the face of an estimated 30,000 abortions that happen annually in the country. She said that a woman’s background is what authorities in El Salvador will look at to discern whether her pregnancy ended naturally or was purposefully terminated. “Doctors in those cases tend to suspect patients whose storyline would suggest reasons to want an abortion,” she said, such as rape victims, single mothers or those living in gang-infested territories where their personal safety is at risk. “The cases that get reported out are the ones against the poorest and most marginalized folks in society. And the cases that prosecutors move forward on are similarly those where they can tell a story about motive.” Local prosecutors who overstep the law Anti-abortion activists say they have been consistent in their approach not to aim criminal anti-abortion laws at the woman obtaining the abortion, and that the directive will remain at the forefront if Roe is overturned. “I do know we’ve seen pretty much across the board, with very few exceptions, a real commitment of lawmakers to make it clear that the woman cannot be prosecuted,” said Katie Glenn, government affairs counsel for the anti-abortion group, Americans United for Life. Jason Rapert, an Oklahoma lawmaker who sponsored a “trigger” abortion ban that will go in effect in the state if Roe is overturned, dismissed the idea that women will be targeted, calling the concerns “a new false flag that’s being thrown up just to raise an issue.” Asked how investigators will determine whether a miscarriage was natural or a medically-induced abortion, Rapert said that, “You’re also talking about the honesty of the person. “And I believe that people will be able to discern what is a miscarriage and what is not,” Rapert, who is also founder and president of the National Association of Christian Lawmakers, told CNN. While it will be up to legislators to write the anti-abortion laws that they hope will end the procedure, carrying those laws will ultimately fall to local prosecutors. A prosecutor in Texas Starr County attracted national attention this year for trying to charge a woman with murder for her self-induced abortion, despite the exemption in the relevant Texas law for the “conduct committed by the mother of the unborn child.” The prosecutor’s office said it was dropping the charges after a review the Texas law. “In Starr County, the prosecutor initially, and those that initially put the charges together, misunderstood and misapplied the law,” John Seago, Texas’ Right to Life legislative director, said. “And so that’s possible, but that’s possible with any crime.” This story has been updated following the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade on June 24. (Index: 31)\n",

      "Selected Random Sample: Lauren Handy and four others were found guilty of illegally blocking access to a Washington abortion clinic. No charges have been filed in connection with five fetuses that were found in her home last year. Lauren Handy was found guilty of federal civil rights offenses, alongside four other anti-abortion activists. Prosecutors said she directed the invasion and blockade of an abortion clinic in Washington, D.C., in 2020. Five anti-abortion activists, including one who was found to have kept five fetuses in her home last year, were found guilty of federal civil rights offenses on Tuesday after blocking access to an abortion clinic in Washington, D.C., in 2020. Lauren Handy of Virginia, who prosecutors said directed the invasion and blockade of the abortion clinic on Oct. 22, 2020, and her co-defendants were each convicted of a felony charge of conspiracy against rights and of violating the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act. The law makes it a crime to threaten, obstruct or injure a person seeking access to a reproductive health clinic or to damage clinic property. Prosecutors said that Ms. Handy had arrived for an appointment she had made at the clinic under a false name. She and other defendants “forcefully pushed” their way into the waiting room and used their bodies, furniture, chains and ropes to block its doors, prosecutors said. The defendants, who were livestreaming their blockade on Facebook, blocked a patient from entering the treatment area and left a nurse with a sprained ankle, prosecutors said. Also convicted in the case were Herb Geraghty of Pittsburgh; William Goodman of the Bronx; John Hinshaw of Levittown, N.Y.; and Heather Idoni of Linden, Mich. They each face up to 11 years in prison. A sentencing date has not been set.  Four others who were charged in connection with the clinic’s blockade are scheduled go on trial next week. A 10th defendant pleaded guilty in March. Ms. Handy became the focus of widespread public attention in March 2022, the day after she was charged in connection with the clinic blockade, when the police announced they had found five fetuses in a home that the anti-abortion group said was hers. The Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia said investigators had acted on a tip about “potential biohazard material.” The local CBS affiliate television station WUSA reported at the time that investigators carried evidence out of Ms. Handy’s basement in red biohazard bags and coolers. Ms. Handy declined to say what was in the coolers, but said “people would freak out when they heard,” the station reported. The investigation into the fetuses was ongoing, and no one has been charged in connection with the discovery, the police said on Wednesday. The police department has previously said that the abortions of the fetuses were legal under D.C. law and that their investigation would focus on how the remains ended up in the house. Ms. Handy and the founder of the anti-abortion group, Terrisa Bukovinac, claimed that they obtained a box of 115 fetuses from the driver of a medical waste truck outside the clinic that Ms. Handy previously blockaded. The activists claimed that they buried 110 of the fetuses and said that their lawyer had asked the police to retrieve the five remaining ones from her home, saying they were considered evidence of violations of federal laws. The medical waste company that owned the truck denied that account and said it was cooperating with the authorities. Ms. Handy and her co-defendants have already taken steps to appeal their convictions, the executive director of Progressive Anti-Abortion Uprising, Caroline Taylor Smith, said in a phone interview. Because the federal jury found that the defendants acted with violent force, they were immediately taken into custody and held at the Alexandria Detention Center in Virginia, Ms. Smith said, adding that the group was “more motivated than ever” to push for the repeal of the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act. The federal law was passed in 1994 in response to an escalation in violent attacks by anti-abortion activists on clinics and doctors, including on Dr. David Gunn, who was fatally shot during a protest outside his clinic in Pensacola, Fla., in 1993. Dr. Gunn’s murder is believed to be the first targeted killing of an abortion provider in the United States. (Index: 235)\n",

      "Selected Random Sample: Judge Joseph Seidlin put a hold on the law, which prohibits abortion after six weeks of pregnancy, days after the governor signed it. Supporters of abortion rights gathered last week to protest at the Iowa State Capitol in Des Moines, during a special legislative session to pass an abortion ban. On Friday, Iowa’s Republican governor signed a strict new abortion ban into law. And for three days, most abortions in Iowa were illegal past six weeks of pregnancy. Until Monday afternoon, when a district judge put the ban on hold. Joseph Seidlin, a district court judge in Polk County, said that the new ban would be suspended  while the larger legal case against it moved forward. He said in his ruling that the plaintiffs who filed a lawsuit against the ban, including the American Civil Liberties Union, Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers, were likely to succeed on the merits of their case. That means that abortion in Iowa is once again legal up to around 22 weeks of pregnancy, at least for now. “We are deeply relieved that the court granted this relief so essential health care in Iowa can continue,’’ said Dr. Abbey Hardy-Fairbanks, medical director of the Emma Goldman Clinic, one of the plaintiffs. “We are also acutely aware that the relief is only pending further litigation and the future of abortion in Iowa remains tenuous and threatened.” The legal whiplash is the latest turn in the conservative state’s yearslong struggle to restrict the procedure. At least a dozen Republican states have banned or severely restricted abortion since the United States Supreme Court ruled last year that it was not protected in the Constitution. in 2018, Iowa legislators passed a six-week ban that was challenged in court, and could not be enforced when the State Supreme Court deadlocked over it in June. The governor, Kim Reynolds, called a special session to pass another ban, which the Legislature did this month. “The abortion industry’s attempt to thwart the will of Iowans and the voices of their elected representatives continues today, but I will fight this all the way to the Iowa Supreme Court where we expect a decision that will finally provide justice for the unborn,” Governor Reynolds said on Monday. In his ruling, Judge Seidlin said that he chose to preserve the status quo set by the Iowa Supreme Court when it deadlocked on the previous ban, and called the new bill “virtually identical” to the one passed in 2018. “There are good, honorable and intelligent people — morally, politically and legally — on both sides of this upsetting societal and constitutional dilemma,” he wrote in his ruling. Iowa Democrats said the decision, though not the final word on the case, was a win. “Iowans support and deserve their fundamental right to make health care decisions about their own bodies,” said Representative Jennifer Konfrst, the Democratic minority leader of the House. The measure passed last week by Republicans allows for abortions until there is a “detectable fetal heartbeat” — a term that medical groups dispute because the embryo does not have a fully formed heart at that stage. Rather, there is cardiac cellular activity, which generally occurs at roughly six weeks into pregnancy, before many women even realize they are pregnant. Iowa providers and abortion-rights advocates filed suit within hours of the Legislature’s passage, saying it was unconstitutional under the standard of “undue burden.” The legislation includes exceptions after that point in cases of rape or incest, when the woman’s life is in serious danger or she faces a risk of certain permanent injuries, or when fetal abnormalities “incompatible with life” are present.

      "Selected Random Sample: The court said the state Constitution provides a limited right to abortion, but not a “fundamental” one. Indiana was the first state to pass an abortion ban after the Supreme Court’s ruling striking down Roe v. Wade. A ruling by Indiana’s highest court on Friday cleared the way for a ban in the state on most abortions from conception. The court said that the state Constitution guarantees a limited right to abortion, but not a fundamental one — that means allowing abortion only when it is necessary to save a woman’s life or protect her from a serious health risk. The court’s decision removes the temporary injunction on a near-total ban on abortion that the state’s Republican-controlled legislature passed last August, after the United States Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and the right to abortion under the U.S. Constitution. The Indiana case resembles those in other states, where abortion-rights groups have challenged bans passed after Roe’s reversal by arguing that varying provisions in state constitutions protect a right to abortion. On Friday, a federal judge ruled that the bulk of a North Carolina abortion ban after 12 weeks of pregnancy could move forward.

      "Selected Random Sample: Gov. Kim Reynolds called the Legislature for a special session to consider sweeping new restrictions on abortion. Protesters outside a public hearing during a special session of the Iowa legislature on Tuesday. Less than a month after a deadlocked Iowa Supreme Court left a six-week abortion ban unenforceable, lawmakers returned to the State Capitol on Tuesday and passed a nearly identical set of restrictions on the procedure. Gov. Kim Reynolds, a Republican who said, “I believe the pro-life movement is the most important human rights cause of our time” when she called the special session on abortion, plans to sign the bill into law on Friday, her office said. “The voices of Iowans and their democratically elected representatives cannot be ignored any longer, and justice for the unborn should not be delayed,” Governor Reynolds said in a statement on Tuesday night. The session further cemented Iowa’s sharp political shift to the right, and was set to end its increasingly rare status as a Republican-led state where abortions are allowed up to 20 weeks post-fertilization, or roughly 22 weeks into pregnancy. The new limits would add Iowa to a list of conservative states including Indiana, North Dakota and South Carolina that have passed abortion restrictions since the U.S. Supreme Court ended the national right to abortion last year. But courts in some of those states have temporarily blocked the laws from taking effect, pending the outcome of lawsuits from abortion providers who say the laws violate various provisions in state constitutions. And Iowa providers and advocates for abortion rights filed suit within hours of the Iowa vote on Wednesday, saying it was unconstitutional under the standard of “undue burden.” As the legislature began its special session on Tuesday, Iowans on both sides of the debate gathered at the Capitol in Des Moines, holding signs with messages like, “My Body, My Choice” and wearing T-shirts with slogans like, “Unborn Lives Matter.” Every seat was claimed inside a public hearing before a House committee, with scores of others standing in the hallways and chanting, “Abortion bans have got to go.” The call for a special session infuriated but did not surprise Iowa Democrats, who celebrated the court’s deadlock a few weeks ago but knew that Republicans, who control both chambers of the Legislature, were likely to try again. The Iowa Supreme Court’s deadlock left in place a lower court’s injunction that blocked enforcement of a six-week ban, but it also left unsettled the broader question of whether such restrictions were permissible under the state’s Constitution. Supporters of abortion rights said the new limits passed by lawmakers endangered women’s health and ran counter to public opinion. Gov. Kim Reynolds on a stage in front of a red backdrop with white stars. Gov. Kim Reynolds of Iowa during a panel discussion in Orlando, Fla., last year. “They have overplayed their hand,” Senator Pam Jochum, the leader of the Democratic minority, said in an interview at the Capitol on Tuesday. But while members of her caucus fought the measure, Ms. Jochum said the large Republican margins limited their options. The bill passed by Republicans allows for abortions until the point where there is what the bill calls “detectable fetal heartbeat,” a term that medical groups dispute.  The legislation assumes this is roughly six weeks of pregnancy, before many women know they are pregnant. The legislation includes exceptions after that point for rape or incest, when the woman’s life is in serious danger or she faces a risk of certain permanent injuries, or when fetal abnormalities “incompatible with life” are present. In public testimony on Tuesday, supporters and opponents of the legislation each told wrenching personal stories and described how religious beliefs shaped their views on abortion. The Rev. Katie Styrt, a Presbyterian pastor from Davenport, described seeking an abortion several years ago when she was pregnant with twins, one of whom was found to have severe complications and would not be able to survive. She said she had hoped to save the other twin by getting the abortion. “We had the health care and the doctors we needed to get us where we needed to be,” Ms. Styrt said. “Now, if this bill passes, we won’t.” Others said passing the restrictions was a moral imperative. “I understand both sides: I was a woman who exercised choice to have an abortion; this is why I advocate to prevent other women experiencing what I have gone through,” Kristi Judkins, the executive director of Iowa Right to Life, told legislators. “People have labeled me a hypocrite, but I ask you: Who here would tell someone to make the same negative, permanent, life-changing mistake?” Sweeping restrictions on abortion in Iowa would further erode access to the procedure in the Midwest, where it is already limited in many states. But a new law would almost certainly face a fresh legal challenge, and the outcome in the courts would again be uncertain. Abortion is banned in almost all cases in the bordering states of Missouri, South Dakota and Wisconsin, and a new 12-week ban recently passed in Nebraska. Illinois and Minnesota, which are led by Democrats, have permissive abortion laws and could become destinations for Iowa women seeking abortions. More than 3,700 abortions were performed in Iowa in 2021, according to state data, most of them by medication. The new limits passed on Tuesday after hours of intense debate that extended well into the evening. “If this bill becomes law, women will die in Iowa,” State Representative Beth Wessel-Kroeschell, a Democrat, told her colleagues. “Common sense has walked out the door.” Republicans defended the bill, and voted down several amendments from Democrats that would have expanded exceptions. “Unborn people, in my opinion, are babies, and government’s job is to protect the rights of every person, including babies,” State Representative Brad Sherman, a Republican, said on the House floor. A Des Moines Register-Mediacom Iowa poll from this year found that 61 percent of adults in the state believed abortion should be legal in most or all cases, while 35 percent believed it should be illegal in most or all cases. But last year, when Democrats nationally ran on abortion rights, retaking state legislative chambers and holding governorships, the party floundered in Iowa, which not so long ago was viewed as a state where voters might swing to either party. Governor Reynolds won re-election in a landslide, Republicans swept the state’s congressional seats and voters unseated the attorney general and treasurer, both Democrats who had held office for decades. Though Iowans voted twice for President Barack Obama, and Democrats held a majority in the State Senate as recently as 2016, the state is now solidly Republican. Only one Democrat, Rob Sand, the state auditor, still holds statewide office, and the national Democratic Party has moved to push Iowa’s coveted first-in-the-nation caucuses later in the nominating calendar. Republicans, for their part, have wasted no time remaking Iowa in a more conservative image. Ms. Reynolds signed laws this year that banned hormone therapy for transgender children, loosened child labor rules and limited Mr. Sand’s powers. And with Republicans keeping Iowa at the start of their nominating calendar, the party’s presidential hopefuls have been flooding the state. State Representative Jennifer Konfrst, the leader of the Democratic minority in the Iowa House, said the state was not as conservative as recent election results suggested. Although Democrats are not likely to retake a legislative chamber next year, Ms. Konfrst said they saw an opportunity to expand their statehouse numbers in 2024 and regain a foothold in the congressional delegation. New abortion limits, she said, would have the potential to mobilize Democratic voters who sat out the last election. “Our best case is going to be to hold Republicans accountable for going against what Iowans want,” said Ms. Konfrst, who represents parts of suburban Des Moines. “The fact that they’re hurrying it through in July, a year before an election, shows that politically they know this is unpopular.” But Iowa Republicans have made no efforts to hide their support for abortion restrictions, and they have kept winning elections anyway. “Iowans have elected us on the promise to defend the unborn, and we will continue to follow through on that promise,” State Representative Matt Windschitl, the majority leader in the House, said. The same poll that showed broad support for abortion rights this year also showed that more Iowans approved than disapproved of how the State Legislature was doing its job. And nearly two-thirds of those surveyed disapproved of President Biden’s job performance. (Index: 211)\n"

      "Selected Random Sample: Supporters of protecting abortion in the state’s Constitution submitted enough signatures to get on the November ballot. But another vote in August could make it harder to win. Protesters at an abortion rights rally in Dayton, Ohio, last year. Ohio moved one step closer to becoming the next big test case in the nation’s fight over abortion, after supporters of a measure that would ask voters to establish a right to abortion in the state’s Constitution this week said they had filed more than enough signatures to put it on the ballot in November. Ohioans United for Reproductive Rights said on Wednesday that it had collected roughly 710,000 signatures across all of the state’s 88 counties over the last 12 weeks. Under state law, the coalition needed 413,466 to qualify for the ballot. State election officials now have until July 25 to verify the signatures. Supporters of abortion rights are turning to ballot measures in the aftermath of the ruling last year by the United States Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade, which for 50 years had guaranteed a right to abortion in the federal Constitution. They are betting on polls showing that public opinion increasingly supports some right to abortion, and opposes the bans and stricter laws that conservative state legislatures have enacted since the court’s decision. Voters in six states, including conservative ones such as Kentucky and Kansas, voted to protect or establish a right to abortion in their constitutions in last year’s elections, and abortion rights advocates in about 10 other states are considering similar plans. Anti-abortion advocates have become more reluctant to use ballot measures, but that does not mean they have stopped pushing to enact stricter limits. In Iowa, where the State Supreme Court last month declined in a deadlocked vote to lift a block on a near-total abortion ban, anti-abortion advocates have explored adding an amendment to the state’s Constitution saying that there is no right to abortion.  On Wednesday, Gov. Kim Reynolds, a Republican, led a different approach, announcing that she was ordering a special session of the Legislature to convene next week with the sole purpose of enacting another ban. The court’s decision, she said, “disregards the will of Iowa voters and lawmakers.” In Ohio, at a news conference after delivering the truckload of signed petitions on Wednesday, members of Ohioans United for Reproductive Rights expressed confidence about a November vote. “We know from providing 50 years of abortion care that people from every corner of this state need this service,” said Sri Thakkilapati, a founder of the group and the executive director of the Cleveland abortion clinic Preterm. “And we know from collecting signatures in every single one of Ohio’s 88 counties that people support this right.” But the November ballot measure is not the only one that will carry big stakes for the future of abortion in Ohio. Republicans who oppose abortion rights — and who control the state’s General Assembly — have proposed another measure that would make it harder to pass the ballot measure. Republican leaders in the legislature have placed a measure on the ballot for a special election in August that would raise the threshold required to pass any ballot measure amending the state’s Constitution to 60 percent, from a simple majority. They aimed that measure — which would require 50 percent of voters to pass — squarely at the abortion question. Earlier this year the same Republicans passed a law eliminating almost all August elections, arguing that they were expensive and had such low turnout as to be undemocratic. While summer elections tend to have low turnouts and favor those sponsoring the measures, Republicans in Kansas who attempted to strike a right to abortion from the state’s Constitution last August failed, with an unexpectedly high proportion of residents turning out to reject it. The August measure in Ohio, however, will not specifically mention abortion, and it’s not clear that abortion rights advocates will be able to energize their supporters as effectively as their counterparts in Kansas did. Michael Gonidakis, the longtime president of Ohio Right to Life, cast doubt on the significance of the signatures delivered by abortion rights supporters this week. He noted that a group that attempted an amendment on criminal justice in 2018 submitted more than 730,000 signatures, but fewer than half were declared valid. And 63 percent of voters ultimately rejected the proposal. The Republican-led legislature in Ohio passed a law in 2019 banning abortion after six weeks of pregnancy — before many women know they are pregnant — with exceptions to save the life of the mother or prevent “major impairment” of a bodily function, but not for rape or incest. That law took effect after Roe was overturned, but a county court judge put a hold on it, saying that the Ohio Constitution provided a “fundamental right to abortion,” in part because it granted equal protection and benefit to women. That leaves abortion legal up until 22 weeks of pregnancy. The ballot measure would amend the Constitution to add “the Right to Reproductive Freedom with Protections for Health and Safety Amendment,” which in many ways resembles the protections established by Roe. It would establish a right to abortion but allow the procedure to be prohibited after the fetus is viable outside the womb, generally around 23 or 24 weeks. It would allow limits on abortion before viability so long as those laws used the “least restrictive means to advance the individual’s health” according to “widely accepted and evidence-based standards of care.” In a statement, the leaders of Ohioans United for Reproductive Rights declared that the amendment would “ensure patients and doctors, not government extremists, are in control of making private medical decisions.” But in a flurry of statements and Twitter posts, anti-abortion groups hinted that they intended to argue that the amendment is extreme. The anti-abortion coalition Protect Women Ohio insisted that signature collectors had lied about the amendment, and argued that it would “strip parents of their rights, permit minors to undergo sex-change operations without their parents’ knowledge or consent and allow painful abortion on demand through all nine months,” despite the language allowing the state to prohibit abortions after viability. In a Public Religion Research Institute poll in December, 66 percent of Ohio residents said abortion should be legal in all or most cases, up from 56 percent in December 2018. A correction was made on July 7, 2023: An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to the August election in which Ohio voters will be asked whether to raise the threshold for passing state constitutional amendments. It will be a special election, not a primary. (Index: 217)\n",
      "Selected Random Sample: Turnout for Tuesday's abortion vote is expected to be robust Ohio governor urges voters to oppose abortion amendment to the constitution that goes \"way, way too far\" Ohio’s Republican Gov. Mike DeWine spoke to Fox News Digital about how a November abortion measure in Ohio is too extreme for Ohio and goes even farther than Roe v. Wade. Ohio voters will head to the voting booth on Tuesday to vote on a measure that will enshrine abortion access into the state’s constitution in an election that is believed to be a bellwether for how states will be governed on abortion post the Supreme Court’s reversal of Roe v. Wade. What does a \"yes\" or \"no\" vote on Ohio Issue 1 mean? Voters in Ohio who vote \"yes\" on Issue 1 are voting to approve an amendment that would \"establish in the Constitution of the State of Ohio an individual right to one’s own reproductive medical treatment, including but not limited to abortion\" and \"create legal protections for any person or entity that assists a person with receiving reproductive medical treatment.\" A \"no\" vote continues with the status quo in terms of Ohio laws already on the books and leaves current abortion restrictions intact. Who supports and opposes the ballot measure? \"Yes\" on Issue 1 supporters include Ohioans United for Reproductive Right, a coalition of pro-abortion groups, Planned Parenthood, the Human Rights Campaign and the ACLU of Ohio who argue the vote is about \"who makes personal decisions for yourself and your family – you or the government.\" Opponents of Issue 1 include top elected Republicans in the state, Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, many faith based groups including the Catholic Conference of Ohio, and Christians for Civic Virtue. Ohio abortion vote Claire Schmitt, an employee of the anti-abortion organization Protect Women Ohio, walks on November 3, 2023 in Westerville, Ohio. Ohioans will vote on Issue 1, officially titled \"The Right to Reproductive Freedom with Protections for Health and Safety,\" which would codify reproductive rights in the Ohio Constitution Last month, a bipartisan group of 100 Black pastors signed a letter opposing Issue 1 writing that it is \"more extreme than Roe v. Wade\" and \"will allow for painful, late-term abortions through all nine months of pregnancy – even after an unborn baby can feel pain.\" \"It will permit our children to undergo abortions without parents knowing. And it will continue to rob generations of Black women and men of the insurmountable joy of parenthood,\" the letter said. Parents rights advocates have also been involved opposing Issue 1 including Protect Women Ohio. \"The ACLU paid out-of-state signature collectors to lie to Ohioans about their dangerous amendment that will strip parents of their rights, permit minors to undergo sex change operations without their parents’ knowledge or consent, and allow painful abortion on demand through all nine months,\" PWO spokesperson Amy Natoce said. Top Republicans in Ohio have warned the \"extreme\" ballot measure goes \"too far\" and goes even farther than Roe v. Wade. Mike DeWine Republican Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine \"It's pretty clear that this constitutional amendment just goes farther, much further than what the average Ohioan approves,\" Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine told Fox News Digital last month. \"If a voter is comfortable with abortion up until the time of birth, they're probably going to be okay with this amendment — if they're comfortable with parents not being involved in the most important decision their daughter will ever make or certainly has made up until that point in her life. If they're okay with that, then they should vote for this,\" DeWine added. Ohio’s Republican attorney general, Dave Yost, published a report on what he believes a \"Yes\" vote would mean for the future of abortion in Ohio and wrote that the language of the amendment \"creates a new, legal standard that goes beyond what Roe and Casey said.\" Ohio State Issue 1 An attendee holds a rosary as she prays during a \"rosary rally\" on Sunday, Aug. 6, 2023, in Norwood, Ohio. \"The Amendment would not return things to how they were before Dobbs overruled Roe, and is not just ‘restoring Roe,’\" Yost said. \"It goes further.\" Yost wrote that several abortion restrictions in the state would be invalidated if the new amendment passes including the Heartbeat Act, the Down Syndrome discrimination law, and the law prohibiting partial birth abortion. Additionally, Yost concludes that several other aspects related to abortion might not immediately be invalidated but will face serious legal challenges with an \"uncertain outcome\" in courts due to the vague language. Those issues include 24-hour waiting period and informed consent, Ohio law that requires a doctor to inform a minor’s parents before performing an abortion on a pregnant minor, abortion pill safety regulations, limits against taxpayer funds for abortion providers. Both sides of the argument have accused the other side of running misleading ads and voters have expressed confusion on what the amendment will actually do \"I think that most people are trying to understand if this amendment would give them more health protections and our stance has been it actually takes away basic health and care protections for women,\" Mehek Cooke an attorney who serves as spokesperson for Protect Women Ohio, told Fox News Digital.  \"The other side continues to say that Ohio law contains no exceptions for the life of the mothers actually Ohio law permits abortions up until 22 weeks with the exception of immediate serious risk to the mother. There are several exceptions in Ohio law and we've really had to correct that misinformation.\" Cooke told Fox News Digital that Ohio law currently protects serious medical conditions during pregnancy, something she has experienced first hand, and that the other side has used \"scaremongering\" tactics by claiming women will not be able to access medical treatment if the ballot measure fails. ACLU logo An ACLU press release quoted Ohioans United for Reproductive Rights spokesperson Lauren Blauvelt last month saying opponents of Issue 1 are the \"extremists\" and are \"trying to take away our rights and mislead voters.\" Ohioans United for Reproductive Rights spokesperson Lauren Blauvelt said in an ACLU press release last month that its the opponents of Issue 1 that are the \"extremists\" who are \"trying to take away our rights and mislead voters.\" \"Voting NO hands your most personal family decisions over to the GOVERNMENT,\" Blauvelt said. Abortion supporters and opponents nationwide will be watching to see how the amendment fares in a red state that former President Trump carried by 8 points and if any lessons will be learned in other states planning to vote on abortion after the reversal of Roe  Mini Timmaraju, president and CEO of Reproductive Freedom for All, said Ohio offers a vital proving ground heading into next year’s presidential election, when Democrats hope the abortion issue can energize supporters in contests up and down the ballot. Abortion-related initiatives could be on the ballot across the country, including in the presidential swing states of Arizona, Nevada and Pennsylvania. \"When we’re able to see how our messaging impacts independents and Republicans and persuades them that this fundamental freedom is important to protect in Ohio, that’s going to be something that we can implement looking at 2024,\" she said. Marching through the streets Protestors hold signs as they march through the streets of New York City in response to the Supreme Court's ruling on Roe v. Wade. (Fox News Digital) The battleground on abortion shifted to the states last summer, when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned its Roe v. Wade decision, erasing federal abortion protections that had been in place for half a century. Since then, voters in six states — California, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Montana and Vermont — have either supported measures protecting abortion rights or rejected efforts aimed at eroding access. Turnout in the election that concludes Tuesday is expected to be robust, building on the enthusiasm from the summer, organizers say. Local election officials anticipate 40% to 50% of registered voters will participate, according to the Ohio Association of Election Officials. That’s higher than a typical off-year November election and up from the 39% turnout in August. (Index: 76)\n",
      "Selected Random Sample: Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio is seen as one of the most vulnerable Democrats in the chamber, with three Republicans vying to unseat him next year. In the opening minutes of a debate during Sherrod Brown’s successful 2006 campaign for Senate, the Republican incumbent attacked him over “partial-birth abortion,” a phrase often weaponized by conservatives at the time to paint Democrats as somewhere between immoral and murderous. Mr. Brown, a Democrat from northeast Ohio in the House at the time, glanced at his notes. He opposed “late-term abortion,” he said in a measured voice. He denounced the mere idea that Congress would limit any procedure that could “save a woman’s health.” With that, he quickly pivoted. Mr. Brown used the rest of his time to burnish his political brand as a blue-collar economic populist. Nearly 18 years later, abortion will again be a central point of contention as Senator Brown fights for re-election against one of three Republicans trying to unseat him next year. One difference, other than that his shaggy dark hair is now shaded with gray, is that he is preparing to fully lean into his defense of abortion rights. “This issue’s not going away,” Mr. Brown said in an interview. “Women don’t trust Republicans on abortion, and they won’t for the foreseeable future — and they’re not going to trust these guys running against me.” Since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year, abortion rights has become an invaluable political asset for Democrats. They have leveraged the issue to hold onto control of the Senate, limit losses in the House and, this month, fuel victories in key state races across the Midwest and the South. But perhaps the toughest test for the issue’s power will come in Senate contests like Mr. Brown’s in Ohio and Senator Jon Tester’s in Montana. The fate of the razor-thin Democratic majority in the chamber could well be sealed in those two places, by the same voters who have installed Republicans in every other statewide office. Senator Jon Tester of Montana talking to reporters, smiling and gesturing with his arms wide. Senator Jon Tester of Montana, like Mr. Brown, has often focused on local issues in his campaigns, rather than dominant national ones like abortion. So far, voters even in conservative states have consistently prioritized abortion protections over their partisanship. That was true last year in Kansas, where 59 percent of voters rejected a measure to remove abortion rights protections from the State Constitution, and again this month in Ohio, where 57 percent of voters agreed to enshrine such rights in their Constitution. The open question is whether Mr. Brown, 71, and Mr. Tester, 67, can maintain their invaluable political personas while — for the first time in their lengthy careers in public office — persuading their constituents to keep abortion rights front and center when voting next year. Politics Across the United States A Troubling Accusation: Details of a sexual assault allegation against the chairman of the Florida Republican Party in an affidavit from state authorities are fueling turmoil within the party. The chairman has denied any wrongdoing. A Key Issue: Will the issue of abortion rights help red-state Democrats like Senators Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Jon Tester of Montana win re-election in 2024? The party’s razor-thin majority in the upper chamber may depend on it. Pennsylvania’s Mail-In Ballots: A federal judge in Pennsylvania ruled that mail-in ballots that are received on time but are undated should be counted. The decision could have national implications heading into the 2024 election. ‘No Labels’: The centrist organization that is vying to gain ballot access for the 2024 presidential election, has joined forces with Javier Palomarez, an advocate of Hispanic-owned businesses with a history of allegations of workplace financial misconduct and sexual harassment. Both Democrats have long supported abortion rights, but their electoral successes trace back to carefully tailored campaigns that catered to local issues over dominant national ones like abortion. That individuality was how both men won re-election in 2018, even though their states voted for Donald J. Trump in 2016 and 2020. For Mr. Tester, this has meant campaigning on policies he has focused on in the Senate, where he serves on committees overseeing agricultural, Native American and veterans issues. His first television ads this campaign strike similar tones. One features Mr. Tester — a paunchy former schoolteacher with a flattop haircut and a left hand missing three fingers from a boyhood accident with a meat grinder — describing himself as both physically and philosophically different from his congressional colleagues. “I may not look like the other senators,” Mr. Tester says, “but that’s not stopping me from making Washington understand what makes Montana so special.” In Ohio, Mr. Brown has built his reputation on middle-class economic issues, including fighting corporate tax breaks and the high cost of health care. In a 2004 book, “Myths of Free Trade: Why America Trade Policy Has Failed,” he argued that unregulated trade deals had reopened the country’s class divide. This year, Mr. Brown’s campaign has already released a video attacking his three potential Republican challengers as extreme on abortion. In Montana, the Democratic Party has taken a similar approach on behalf of Mr. Tester. “The thing I think a lot of people miss with Sherrod is that he knows abortion is an economic issue,” said Nan Whaley, a Democratic former mayor of Dayton, Ohio, who ran for governor last year. “Abortion rights and abortion access maybe wasn’t discussed as much in previous campaigns, but that’s because it was before the fall of Roe.” Frank LaRose, the secretary of state of Ohio, sitting at a desk and talking in a sunlit room. A piece of artwork in the shape of Ohio is on the wall in front of him. Frank LaRose, the secretary of state of Ohio and one of the Republicans running against Mr. Brown, has supported a national abortion ban. The task for the two Democrats will be complicated by a political headwind that neither senator has confronted: seeking re-election on a ballot topped by an unpopular president from their own party. Both first won election to the Senate by unseating incumbents in 2006, when discontent over the Iraq war and Republican corruption scandals helped Democrats make gains in Congress. Each was re-elected in 2012, when Democrats scored huge majorities from Black and Hispanic voters as President Barack Obama won a second term. They won again in 2018, a Democratic wave year propelled by opposition to Mr. Trump. Republicans are already trying to massage their message on abortion. The National Republican Senatorial Committee is coaching candidates to oppose a national abortion ban and to clearly state their support for exceptions when it comes to rape, incest or a woman’s health. But not all Republicans are on board, as the party’s Senate primary race in Ohio shows. One top candidate, Frank LaRose, the Ohio secretary of state, has supported a national ban and opposed exceptions for rape and incest — and also unsuccessfully campaigned against the abortion ballot question. Another contender, Bernie Moreno, a businessman seeking his first elected office, has said he supports exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the woman, but he told a reporter from Breitbart News last year that he did not. He has also expressed support for a 15-week federal ban. Matt Dolan, a Republican state senator, walking in between houses as he knocked on voters’ doors in 2022. Matt Dolan, a Republican state senator in Ohio who is also running against Mr. Brown, opposes a national abortion ban. The third leading candidate, Matt Dolan, a state senator, opposed the state’s constitutional amendment this month, but he has a more moderate record on the issue than his opponents. Mr. Dolan opposes a national ban, though he has said he is willing to reconsider that stance. He has criticized abortion ban proposals in Ohio that haven’t included the three main exceptions. “Most Americans agree there should be reasonable limits on abortion and abortion policy will primarily be made at the state level,” Mr. Dolan said in a statement, adding that Mr. Brown held “extreme” views on the issue. Some Republicans have said that Ohio’s ballot referendum means the abortion issue will have less urgency in the state next year. But Democrats contend that Republican support for a federal ban would help keep the issue alive, arguing that such a measure would undermine the will of Ohio voters. A poll commissioned by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee recommended that messaging focus on G.O.P. support for a “national abortion ban” and that politicians should not be involved in “personal medical decisions.” Abortion rights groups have encouraged candidates to simultaneously adopt a “proactive” platform that calls for expanding access to contraception and maternal health resources while highlighting Republican involvement in abortion restrictions. “Campaigns need to quickly define who the villains are here: Republicans overturned Roe, Republicans have been campaigning against Roe for decades, Republicans have been pledging to create a court that would overturn Roe,” said Mini Timmaraju, the president of Reproductive Freedom for All, one of the country’s largest abortion rights groups. “They got it, they did it, they’re responsible. Pin it on them. Do not flinch.” Neither Mr. Brown nor Mr. Tester has been shy about supporting abortion rights. Mr. Tester campaigned in 2018 with Cecile Richards, who had recently stepped down as the president of Planned Parenthood. He said recently that abortion rights had clear resonance in Montana, where libertarian-leaning voters tend to reject perceived government intrusion. Still, Mr. Tester has mostly tailored his campaigns around issues closer to the Continental Divide in his state than the partisan divide in Washington. A group of mostly women, some of them wearing green shirts that say Vote Yes, raising their hands and cheering. Supporters celebrating in Columbus this month after Ohio voters enshrined a right to abortion in the state’s Constitution. Mr. Brown won his first political office in 1974, the year after Roe v. Wade was decided. He has proudly highlighted his 100 percent voting score from Planned Parenthood Action Fund and Reproductive Freedom for All. “My focus has always been on civil rights and women’s rights,” he said. “That leads to a better economy, too — when women have better access to child care and can make decisions for their families.” Mr. Brown was involved in the campaign this year to support the constitutional amendment on abortion, phone-banking alongside the Ohio Democratic Party and frequently bringing up the measure during campaign events. Hours after Ohioans voted, Mr. Brown posted a video on social media that framed his three potential Republican challengers as sitting on the wrong side of the issue. “All of my opponents would support a national abortion ban,” the caption read. If there was any doubt, Mr. Brown made clear in the interview that he saw the political benefit of the issue. Abortion, he said, “will surely be talked about more than in my other races.” (Index: 200)\n",

Vice President Kamala Harris spoke about abortion on Tuesday at Howard University in Washington, D.C. (Pool via APTN) A majority of American voters thinks the FDA-approved prescription medication used to end a pregnancy, mifepristone, should be legal. That’s from the latest Fox News Poll, which measured opinions on the controversial issue, as well as attitudes toward a Supreme Court whose decisions are reshaping public policy on abortion. Approval of the Supreme Court remains near its low, with 41% approving of the job it’s doing. Support for the high court declined to a record 39% in June 2022, after the leak of a draft court opinion on the case deciding Roe v. Wade, but shortly before the ruling that overturned the landmark abortion ruling (June 24, 2022). The court’s approval rating has held between 39-42% since last summer.  Currently, 55% disapprove of the Supreme Court. Fox News Poll on Supreme Court job performance. (Fox News ) The survey, released Thursday, was conducted soon after the April 21 Supreme Court decision that allows full access to mifepristone, commonly known as the abortion pill, while a lawsuit against it makes its way through the lower federal courts.  Sixty-five percent think the abortion pill should be legal – including nearly half of conservatives (46%) and White evangelicals (44%). Plus, more men (68%) than women (63%) support the drug. Overall, 30% of voters believe the abortion medication should be illegal. Fox News Poll on medication abortion. (Fox News) In general, a near-high 56% believe abortion should be legal either all (32%) or most (24%) of the time, while 43% say it should be illegal except in certain circumstances (36%) or always (7%). Support for abortion reached a record 57% last September and has stayed over 50% since last June. By an 8-point margin, voters oppose a law that bans abortion after 6 weeks of pregnancy. That’s a reversal from last May when more favored it by 4 points. Support for a 6-week ban is down across the board, but one of the largest shift is among men, who oppose it by 5 points, while last year they supported it by 13 points. Hispanic voters also flipped their stance, now opposing a 6-week ban by 3 points vs. favoring the law by 17 points a year ago. Republicans are less likely to back the ban now by 7 points. On a 15-week abortion ban, support has held steady: 54% of voters favor it vs. 42% oppose, virtually the same as last year (54-41%). Fox News Poll on abortion bans. (Fox News ) Among Democrats, 28% favor a 6-week ban and 43% favor a 15-week ban, while 84% want mifepristone to be legal.

      "Selected Random Sample: The former president suggested that Republicans needed to talk about exceptions to abortion bans but was otherwise vague about how his party should discuss the issue. During an interview this week, the conservative media personality Tudor Dixon said the former president had advised her to “talk differently about abortion” during her campaign for Michigan governor last year. Former President Donald J. Trump acknowledged this week that Republican positions on abortion were hurting the party, but offered few details after claiming he knew how to thread the needle. Mr. Trump’s remarks during an interview with Tudor Dixon, a conservative media personality who unsuccessfully ran for governor of Michigan last year, are one more sign that Republicans are struggling to adjust to a political environment in which abortion is a liability rather than a vote driver for them. After the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June 2022, the ruling created a backlash that has benefited Democrats in elections across the country. In her interview with Mr. Trump on her podcast on Wednesday, Ms. Dixon said that the former president had advised her during her campaign for governor to “talk differently about abortion.” “We could not pivot in time, and it really, you were absolutely right, sir,” Ms. Dixon told Mr. Trump. “Yep, that’s what happened to you,” Mr. Trump replied. “And that’s what happened to a lot of other people and — didn’t happen to me because, you know, there’s a way of talking about it. They’re the radicals. They’re the radicals, and you have to explain it. And I think exceptions are very important. I think you need the exceptions. You and I talked about that.” Ms. Dixon took a hard line on abortion during her campaign, expressing support for a total ban except in life-threatening emergencies. She emphasized that “health of the mother and life of the mother are two different things” — suggesting that she might not support exceptions for women whose health was at risk if their life wasn’t — and said she would not support abortion for a 14-year-old who had been raped. “I’ve talked to those people who were the child of a rape victim and the bond that those two people made, and the fact that out of that tragedy, there was healing through that baby,” she told a local Fox station last year, adding: “Those voices, the babies of rape victims that have come forward, are very powerful. When you hear their story and what the truth is behind that, it’s very hard to not stand up for those people.” Ms. Dixon lost to Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, the Democratic incumbent, by more than 10 percentage points. How, exactly, Mr. Trump wants to approach abortion is not clear. He has been loath to talk about it on the campaign trail at all, saying he would “look at” federal legislation to prohibit abortion after 15 weeks, which many of his 2024 rivals have embraced, but making no definitive commitment. And he has generally avoided venues — such as the first Republican debate, or mainstream news interviews — where he is likely to be asked tough questions about the issue. In his interview with Ms. Dixon, he emphasized exceptions to abortion bans, but candidates who back exceptions have not been spared from the electoral backlash, and voters have broadly supported abortion rights in referendums even in red states. His reference to Democrats as the real “radicals” mirrors language used by other Republican candidates, who often falsely accuse Democrats of supporting abortion “up until the moment of birth,” which is not a practice even in states without gestational limits. More than 93 percent of abortions take place in the first trimester, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and more than 99 percent in the first half. (Index: 228)\n",

      "Selected Random Sample: CNN  —  The US Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision, which overturned Roe v. Wade, created a fractured abortion landscape in the United States. Nearly a year later, a new KFF survey shows that it has left widespread confusion about the legal status of abortion, along with little trust in the high court to decide cases on reproductive health. Most adults in the United States disapprove of the Supreme Court’s performance in general, the survey found, along with more than 6 of 10 who say that they don’t trust the court’s ability to decide cases related to reproductive and sexual health. In April, the Supreme Court made another significant abortion-related decision, this time protecting access to mifepristone – a drug that is approved for use in medication abortion by the US Food and Drug Administration – which has been challenged in lower courts. Nearly two-thirds of survey participants say that they have at least some confidence in the FDA’s efforts to ensure that medications are safe and effective, and most agree that it would be inappropriate for a court to overturn that authority. Awareness of mifepristone grew significantly in the past year amid the legal attention. But there’s still general uncertainty around the legal status of abortion. In the 14 states where abortion is banned, about 1 in 8 residents incorrectly believes that medication abortion is still legal there. And more than half of residents say they are unsure of the legality of abortion in their state. Amid the confusion and unease, many women are changing their approach to contraception. More than half of women under 50 say that they or someone they know has taken a precaution – such as getting a new prescription for contraception, stocking up on contraception options or delaying getting pregnant – because they were concerned about having access to an abortion, the survey found. And abortion remains a key issue for voters heading into the 2024 presidential election. About 3 in 10 registered voters say that they will vote only for a candidate who shares their views on abortion. No party has a clear majority; about a third say that neither represents their views. But respondents are more likely to say that their views align with the Democratic Party (42%) than the Republican Party (26%). The new KFF survey data is based on responses from a representative sample of about 1,700 adults collected in mid-May. (Index: 26)\n",
      "Selected Random Sample: The Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade makes possible a rise in what are known as self-managed abortions, for which data are harder to collect. Abortion clinics contribute to surveys on how many abortions are performed. (Index: 123)\n",
      "Selected Random Sample: CNN  — While legal battles over access to mifepristone, one of two drugs used for medication abortions, play out in court, the drug continues to be available in states which consider abortion legal. “While many women obtain medication abortion from a clinic or their OB-GYN, others obtain the pills on their own to self-induce or self-manage their abortion,” said Dr. Daniel Grossman, a professor of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive sciences at the University of California, San Francisco. “A growing body of research indicates that self-managed abortion is safe and effective,” he said. Mifepristone blocks the hormone progesterone, which is needed for a pregnancy to continue. The drug is approved to end a pregnancy through 10 weeks’ gestation, which is “70 days or less since the first day of the last menstrual period,” according to the FDA. In a medication abortion, a second drug, misoprostol, is taken within the next 24 to 48 hours. Misoprostol causes the uterus to contract, creating cramping and bleeding. Approved for use in other conditions, such as preventing stomach ulcers, the drug has been available at pharmacies for decades. Together, the two drugs are commonly known as the “abortion pill,” which is now used in more than half of the abortions in the United States, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports abortion rights. “Some people do this because they cannot access a clinic — particularly in states with legal restrictions on abortion — or because they have a preference for self-care,” said Grossman, who is also the director of Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health, a research group that evaluates the pros and cons of reproductive health policies and publishes studies on how abortion affects a woman’s health. What happens in a medication abortion What happens during a medication abortion? To find out, CNN spoke with Grossman. The conversation has been edited for clarity. CNN: What is the difference between a first-trimester medication abortion and a vacuum aspiration in terms of what a woman experiences? Dr. Daniel Grossman: A vacuum aspiration is most commonly performed under a combination of local anesthetic and oral pain medications or local anesthetic together with intravenous sedation, or what is called conscious sedation. An injection of local anesthetic is given to the area around the cervix, and the cervix is gently dilated or opened up. Once the cervix is opened, a small straw-like tube is inserted into the uterus, and a gentle vacuum is used to remove the pregnancy tissue. Contrary to what some say, if the procedure is done before nine weeks or so, there’s nothing in the tissue that would be recognizable as a part of an embryo. The aspiration procedure takes just a couple of minutes; then the person is observed for one to two hours until any sedation has worn off. We also monitor each patient for very rare complications, such as heavy bleeding. Grossman: A medication abortion is a more prolonged process. After taking the pills, bleeding and cramping can occur over a period of days. Bleeding is typically heaviest when the actual pregnancy is expelled, but that bleeding usually eases within a few hours. On average people continue to have some mild bleeding for about two weeks or so, which is a bit longer than after a vacuum aspiration. Nausea, vomiting, fever, chills, diarrhea and headache can occur after using the abortion pill, and everyone who has a successful medication abortion usually reports some pain. In fact, the pain of medication abortion can be quite intense. In the studies that have looked at it, the average maximum level of pain that people report is about a seven to eight out of 10, with 10 being the highest. However, people also say that the pain can be brief, peaking just as the pregnancy is being expelled. The level of cramping and pain can depend on the length of the pregnancy as well as whether or not someone has given birth before. For example, a medical abortion at six weeks or less gestation typically has less pain and cramping than one performed at nine weeks. People who have given birth generally have less pain. CNN: What can be done to help with the pain of a medication abortion? Grossman: There are definitely things that can be used to help with the pain. Research has shown that ibuprofen is better than acetaminophen for treating the pain of medication abortion. We typically advise people to take 600 milligrams every six hours or so as needed. Some people take tramadol, a narcotic analgesic, or Vicodin, which is a combination of acetaminophen and hydrocodone. Recent research I was involved in found medications like tramadol can be helpful if taken prophylactically before the pain starts. Another successful regimen that we studied combined ibuprofen with a nausea medicine called metoclopramide that also helped with pain. Other than ibuprofen, these medications require a prescription. Another study found that a TENS device, which stands for transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulator, helps with the pain of medication abortion. It works through pads put on the abdomen that stimulate the nerves through mild electrical shocks, thus interfering with the pain signals. That’s something people could get without a prescription. Pain can be an overlooked issue with medication abortion because, quite honestly, as clinicians, we’re not there with patients when they are in their homes going through this. But as we’ve been doing more research on people’s experiences with medication abortion, it’s become quite clear that pain control is really important. I think we need to do a better job of treating the pain and making these options available to patients. CNN: Are there health conditions that make the use of a medication abortion unwise? Grossman: Undergoing a medication abortion can be dangerous if the pregnancy is ectopic, meaning the embryo is developing outside of the uterus. It’s rare, happening in about two out of every 100 pregnancies — and it appears to be even rarer among people seeking medication abortion. People who have undergone previous pelvic, fallopian tube or abdominal surgery are at higher risk of an ectopic pregnancy, as are those with a history of pelvic inflammatory disease. Certain sexually transmitted infections can raise risk, as does smoking, a history of infertility and use of infertility treatments such as in vitro fertilization (IVF). If a person is on anticoagulant or blood thinning drugs or has a bleeding disorder, a medication abortion is not advised. The long-term use of steroids is another contraindication for using the abortion pill. Anyone using an intrauterine device, or IUD, must have it removed before taking mifepristone because it may be partially expelled during the process, which can be painful. People with chronic adrenal failure or who have inherited a rare disorder called porphyria are not good candidates. CNN: Are there any signs of trouble a woman should watch for after undergoing a medication abortion? Grossman: It can be common to have a low-grade fever in the first few hours after taking misoprostol, the second drug in a medication abortion. If someone has a low-grade fever — 100.4 degrees to 101 degrees Fahrenheit — that lasts more than four hours, or has a high fever of over 101 degrees Fahrenheit after taking the medications, they do need to be evaluated by a health care provider. Heavy bleeding, which would be soaking two or more thick full-size pads an hour for two consecutive hours, or a foul-smelling vaginal discharge should be evaluated as well. One of the warning signs of an ectopic pregnancy is severe pelvic pain, particularly on one side of the abdomen. The pain can also radiate to the back. Another sign is getting dizzy or fainting, which could indicate internal bleeding. These are all very rare complications, but it’s wise to be on the lookout.We usually recommend that someone having a medication abortion have someone with them during the first 24 hours after taking misoprostol or until the pregnancy has passed. Many people specifically choose to have a medication abortion because they can be surrounded by a partner, family or friends. Most people know that the abortion is complete because they stop feeling pregnant, and symptoms such as nausea and breast tenderness disappear, usually within a week of passing the pregnancy. A home urine pregnancy test may remain positive even four to five weeks after a successful medication abortion, just because it takes that long for the pregnancy hormone to disappear from the bloodstream. If someone still feels pregnant, isn’t sure if the pregnancy fully passed or has a positive pregnancy test five weeks after taking mifepristone, they need to be evaluated by a clinician. People should know that they can ovulate as soon as two weeks after a medication abortion. Most birth control options can be started immediately after a medication abortion. (Index: 8)\n",

      "Selected Random Sample: CNN  —  When 45-year-old Victoria realized she was five weeks late and the lines showed as positive on two pregnancy tests, the New Orleans resident dreamed up a plan to get an abortion. Traveling out of state was the only abortion option for Victoria, who asked CNN to withhold her last name out of fear of backlash against her and her family. Louisiana is one of several states that have essentially banned all abortions. “It was probably one of the hardest things I’ve had to go through, from the moment of discovering that I was pregnant at age 45 to actually having to have to take time off work, travel across the country, do a meeting with a doctor, and then take the pills and then skedaddle back home and then go to work like nothing had happened,” Victoria told CNN of her experience earlier this year. Victoria’s story about the distance she traveled and the hardships she endured to get an abortion reflects a wider American reality, where women seeking the procedure must navigate through a patchwork of states with varying levels of access. The average travel time to an abortion facility more than tripled, from less than 30 minutes to more than an hour and a half, after the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, according to a November study in the Journal of the American Medical Association. And for women in Texas and Louisiana, average travel times to the nearest abortion facility were seven hours longer – almost a full workday in travel time to get an abortion. Victoria says she was grateful she could drop everything and afford to spend $1,000 for the procedure, including same-week airfare with connections both ways and appointment and medication fees. “It was so hard for me wrap my head around the fact that I was able to do this, but I’m one of the lucky ones and that there are so many women who are in much tighter positions,” Victoria said. “And, God, what are they going to do?” Why Oregon? Victoria says plans materialized quickly once she knew which states seemed more accessible. She researched the parameters for abortion in a state, how long she would have to take off work, travel options and how soon she could get an appointment. She found abortionfinder.org to be a helpful and reliable source, she says. “Because the situation is so fluid, it changes from day to day, that was really of paramount importance for me to be able to have a reliable source of information,” she said. Driving to a neighboring state was not an option, as every state adjoining Louisiana has a similarly restrictive law that bans virtually all abortions. Victoria says she considered close states, like Florida, but she ultimately dismissed them because available appointments were farther out. “Once I saw that Oregon was so, so protective of reproductive rights, I said, ‘Why would I think about going anywhere else?’” she said. “The second I got the definitive pregnancy result, I was like, ‘OK, let’s book a flight to Oregon. When can we do this?’” She reached out to a friend from college and asked if she could stay with her, detailing the reason for her visit. She then made an appointment and booked a flight for that week, she says. The provider sent instructions, including that the patient must be in Oregon for the telehealth appointment, according to documents provided to CNN. They contacted her within an hour of making the appointment to make sure she had proof of travel documents because she had made it from Louisiana, where the procedure is illegal. Victoria planned to take a day off to fly across the country and work remotely for two days, which fits her hybrid work situation. She says she was grateful to have a supportive, female boss who showed understanding for why she had to take the unexpected time off. “She was the only person I actually kind of broke down and cried for,” Victoria said. “I think it’s because I had been holding it back all week, and telling her was sort of the last thing that I needed to get in place before I could do everything.” They have different views, but that didn’t matter Victoria says the hardest part of her experience was telling her mother because she didn’t know how her mom would feel about it. Victoria and her siblings were raised Catholic. Her father had a strong faith and her mother was a non-practicing Catholic, her mother says. Victoria’s mom asked not to be named for privacy reasons. Victoria’s mother says she wanted to support her daughter, even if she does not agree with what her daughter did. Victoria coming to her with tickets purchased and a full plan made it easy for her mother to support her, the mother says. “I agreed to drive her to the airport and that that was the only thing I could do because this would be a real game-changing thing in her life,” her mother said. “I wanted to support what she wanted to do because she has supported me on several family crises. I just wanted to do it because I love her. “ Victoria said she appreciated her mom for being supportive in a way she didn’t expect. They talked about some of her mother’s friends who had abortions throughout the years, both say. Victoria’s mother even told her about when she tried to get her tubes tied, but her husband found out and she did not pursue it. “I feel like, if anything, it’s made our relationship stronger,” Victoria said. “We already had a fantastically strong relationship, though. So, it’s another rock in the wall.” Support greets her in Oregon After boarding early on a Wednesday in March, Victoria traveled for eight hours on two flights and landed in Portland, Oregon. Victoria reunited with her friend, and they did the things that old friends do, from staying up late talking about college memories to talking about why Victoria was there. They both described the situation as surreal. “The vast majority of reproductive conversations I have with friends at this point are people who are trying desperately to get pregnant,” said her friend, Emily, who asked that CNN not use her last name to keep Victoria’s privacy. “The sort of irony is that there could still be an unplanned pregnancy and it would still be just as devastating as it would have been when we were in our teens and twenties was kind of a shock to me.” Emily, who has been friends with Victoria for about 25 years, says it took so little effort for her to drive to the airport and let her friend stay with her. “I felt honored that she trusted me,” she said. “I was really proud of Victoria. I was impressed that she had taken this in stride and that she had reached out to someone she knew – I think a lot of people would have been ashamed or hidden it.” After the telehealth appointment the next day, Victoria received an overnight package. Victoria took two medications as part of a medication abortion. She took mifepristone at her friend’s home. The next day she took misoprostol before boarding her flight home – she was careful not to take them in her home state, where it’s illegal. “It was like a heavy period,” she said. “I took some Aleve, had to get some extra jumbo pads, and I bled a lot on the flights home, but it was fine.” Physically, she felt fine – it was more of what was happening psychologically that she noticed, she says. “I had this feeling that I should be having some kind of deep, psychological moment of reckoning or something, but I didn’t really feel that,” Victoria said of the experience. “I’ve never wanted to have a kid. I wasn’t torn about this decision.” Her medical options felt dissonant to the care she received before When Victoria learned she was pregnant, a big part of the shock came from not thinking she could get pregnant at age 45, she says. “You hear so much culturally out there about you’re in your forties, are told you’re too old to get pregnant and carry a child to term,” she said. “I feel like I had sort of a false sense of security.” Victoria joked that she’s “careening toward menopause,” but she says she has not been diagnosed as perimenopausal. Her pregnancy news came several months after she was treated for a uterine fibroid, a benign growth, in July 2022, according to medical records. Victoria also tested positive for a PALB2 gene mutation, which can lead to an increased chance of breast cancer, according to a study in the New England Journal of Medicine. She underwent a preventative double mastectomy and reconstruction earlier in 2022, according to medical records provided to CNN. She says she got an excellent standard of care around her surgeries, but it felt dissonant with her state’s laws around abortion. “It felt so surreal to get this really high standard of care around my secondary sexual characteristics, but then to have that freeze, slam shut when it comes to reproductive health, it just felt abrupt,” she said.

      "Selected Random Sample: California Governor Gavin Newsom (D) slammed Walgreens over its decision to stop selling abortion pills in Republican states with attorneys general who had warned that doing so could put the pharmacy in legal jeopardy. “California won’t be doing business with Walgreens – or any company that cowers to the extremists and puts women’s lives at risk,” Newsom tweeted on Monday. “We’re done.” Newsom’s tweet comes after Walgreens announced last week that it will stop selling the abortion pill mifepristone in the 20 states where Republican attorneys general have outlined objections to the sale of the drug through the mail.  The attorneys general argued in their letter published in February that federal criminal law prohibits the use of the mail to distribute abortion drugs, and noted that the law is enforceable through a private right of action. They also raised questions about the Biden administration’s interpretation of the federal law in play, as the White House argued that the text of the law shouldn’t be “‘[t]aken literally’” despite acknowledging the language of the text. California Gov. Gavin Newsom criticized Walgreens for stopping sales of an abortion drug in 20 states. The AGs wrote: “We reject the Biden administration’s bizarre interpretation, and we expect courts will as well. Courts do not lightly ignore the plain text of statutes. And the Supreme Court has been openly aversive to other attempts by the Biden administration to press antitextual arguments.” The 20 states that have informed Walgreens of their intention to block the sale of mifepristone by mail include Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, Mississippi, Montana, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Utah and West Virginia. There are 20 states that have informed Walgreens of their intention to block the sale of mifepristone by mail. Mifepristone is a drug that was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2000 to cause an abortion or assist with a miscarriage up to the 10th week of pregnancy when used in combination with misoprostol. Mifepristone is used first to dilate the cervix and block a hormone needed to sustain a pregnancy, then misoprostol is taken a day or two later to cause contractions that empty the uterus and end the pregnancy.  For over 20 years, the FDA only permitted mifepristone to be dispensed by specialty offices and clinics due to safety concerns.Mifepristone was authorized for use in abortions by the FDA in 2000. The agency has loosened those requirements and in 2021, eliminated an in-person requirement for obtaining the drug and permitted it to be prescribed via telehealth and shipped by mail-order pharmacies. Those changes have seen the number of medication abortions rise, as they accounted for 54% of all U.S. abortions in 2020, according to the Guttmacher Institute, which supports abortion rights. Earlier this year, the FDA allowed pharmacies like Walgreens to start dispensing the drug after they undergo certification, which entails meeting standards for shipping, tracking, and confidentially storing prescription information. In response to Newsom’s comments, a Walgreens spokesperson told FOX Business, “From the outset, we have made our intentions clear to become a certified pharmacy to distribute mifepristone wherever legally possible to do so.”Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron is one of the 20 state attorneys general who wrote to Walgreens warning of potential legal consequences if they sell abortion drug mifepristone in their states. Walgreens released a statement Monday evening which said: “We want to be very clear about what our position has always been: Walgreens plans to dispense Mifepristone in any jurisdiction where it is legally permissible to do so. Once we are certified by the FDA, we will dispense this medication consistent with federal and state laws. Providing legally approved medications to patients is what pharmacies do, and is rooted in our commitment to the communities in which we operate.” A group opposed to abortion called the Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF) filed a lawsuit in November seeking to revoke the FDA’s authorization of mifepristone. ADF argues that the FDA’s testing of the drugs wasn’t up to its full standards prior to its release onto the market over 20 years ago. A ruling in the federal district court that has heard arguments in the ADF lawsuit against the FDA could come at any time. It’s possible that the case will be appealed, leaving the timeline for a final resolution of the case uncertain. (Index: 150)\n",
